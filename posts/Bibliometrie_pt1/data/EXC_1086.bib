Abstract = {Major depressive disorder is one of the most common mental disorders,
   and more than 300 million of people suffer from depression worldwide.
   Recent clinical trials indicate that deep brain stimulation of the
   superolateral medial forebrain bundle (mfb) can have rapid and long-term
   antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression.
   However, the mechanisms of action are elusive. In this study, using
   female rats, we demonstrate the antidepressant effects of selective
   optogenetic stimulation of the ventral tegmental area's dopaminergic
   (DA) neurons passing through the mfb and compare different stimulation
   patterns. Chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) induced
   depressive-like, but not anxiety-like phenotype. Short-term and
   long-term stimulation demonstrated antidepressant effect (OSST) and
   improved anxiolytic effect (EPM), while long-term stimulation during
   CMUS induction prevented depressive-like behavior (OSST and USV) and
   improved anxiolytic effect (EPM). The results highlight that long-term
   accumulative stimulation on DA pathways is required for antidepressant
   and anxiolytic effect.},

Title = {On the longevity of flexible neural interfaces: Establishing
   biostability of polyimide-based intracortical implants},
Journal = {BIOMATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {281},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Flexible neural implants are extremely favored, as the most successful
   strategy to promote probe-tissue integration and avoid severe gliosis
   relies on reducing the mechanical mismatch between probe and brain
   tissue. But what are the realistic requirements for achieving chronic
   recording stability? What are the critical dimensions and main factors
   determining glial scar-free device integration? To answer these
   questions, two types of hair sized polyimide-based flexible
   intracortical (PIXI) arrays were fabricated, differing only in their
   cross-sectional area. Chronic tissue reaction to both types was
   evaluated in rats, and in different implantation setups. Interfacial
   stresses were found to play a critical role in long-term tissue
   integration. Still, all the devices provided high quality chronic
   recordings of single units and inflammatory gene expression was not
   significantly upregulated for larger devices. Our study points out that
   the most relevant factor in eliciting FBR is played by mechanical probe
   tissue interactions, that polyimide is well tolerated by the tissue, and
   that a holistic design considering material properties, geometrical
   dimensions and assembling techniques is the key towards longevity and
   long-term performance of intracortical probes. The optimization of only
   one parameter did not yet lead to the successful translation of research
   accomplishments into chronic preclinical and clinical applications.},

Abstract = {How neuronal activity of motor cortex is related to movement is a
   central topic in motor neuroscience. Motor-cortical single neurons are
   more closely related to hand movement velocity than speed, that is, the
   magnitude of the (directional) velocity vector. Recently, there is also
   increasing interest in the representation of movement parameters in
   neuronal population activity, such as reflected in the intracranial EEG
   (iEEG). We show that in iEEG, contrasting to what has been previously
   found on the single neuron level, speed predominates over velocity. The
   predominant speed representation was present in nearly all iEEG signal
   features, up to the 600-1000 Hz range. Using a model of motor-cortical
   signals arising from neuronal populations with realistic single neuron
   tuning properties, we show how this reversal can be understood as a
   consequence of increasing population size. Our findings demonstrate that
   the information profile in large population signals may systematically
   differ from the single neuron level, a principle that may be helpful in
   the interpretation of neuronal population signals in general, including,
   for example, EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Taking
   advantage of the robust speed population signal may help in developing
   brain-machine interfaces exploiting population signals.},

Abstract = {With growing availability of robots and rapid advances in robot
   autonomy, their proximity to humans and interaction with them
   continuously increases. In such interaction scenarios, it is often
   evident what a robot should do, yet unclear how the actions should be
   performed. Humans in the scene nevertheless have subjective preferences
   over the range of possible robot policies. Hence, robot policy
   optimization should incorporate the human's preferences. One option to
   gather online information is the decoding of the human's brain signals.
   We present ongoing work on decoding the perceived hazardousness of
   situations based on brain signals from electroencephalography (EEG).
   Based on experiments with participants watching potentially hazardous
   traffic situations, we show that such decoding is feasible and propose
   to extend the approach towards more complex environments such as robotic
   assistants. Ultimately, we aim to provide a closed-loop system for
   human-compliant adaptation of robot policies based on the decoding of
   EEG signals.},

Title = {Electrochemical methods for neural interface electrodes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective. Neural interfaces often rely on charge transfer processes
   between electrodes and the tissue or electrolyte. Electrochemical
   processes are at the core of electrode function and, therefore, the key
   to neural interface stability, electrode performance characterization,
   and utilization of electrodes as chemical sensors. Electrochemical
   techniques offer a variety of options to investigate the charge transfer
   and electrocatalytic properties of electrodes. Approach. In this
   tutorial, we present various experiments to illustrate the power of
   electrochemical methods, serve as a reference and guideline, and
   stimulate deeper understanding of the subject. Main results. As a basis
   for the following experiments, we discuss the platinum cyclic
   voltammogram and focus on understanding surface processes and roughness
   determination. We highlight the importance of appropriate
   instrumentation using potentiostats and how strongly it can influence
   results. We then discuss a number of potential-controlled and
   current-controlled methods for electrode characterization, including
   chronocoulometry, chronoamperometry, (active) potentiometry, and
   chronopotentiometry. They illustrate charge transfer caused by both
   electrode surface processes and the presence of redox-active species,
   such as dissolved oxygen and hydrogen, or hydrogen peroxide. We also
   discuss the electrode potential with respect to a reference electrode
   under various conditions and how it affects its electrochemical
   properties like surface state, catalytic properties and capability to
   transfer charge. Significance. Electrochemical methods are still
   underutilized in neural engineering, and valuable information is
   therefore often not accessed. Many studies on electrode characterization
   would benefit from a more consistent and target-oriented electrochemical
   methodology and instrumentation. That ranges from the investigation of
   new materials and processes, over electrode performance assessment to
   the development of more long-term stable and biocompatible neural
   interfaces. Ultimately, standardization, consistency and comparability
   will play a key role in the translation of microtechnology into
   biomedical and clinical applications.},

Abstract = {Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve
   neurosurgical planning. However, there is a lack of research tools for
   this area. We present a research framework for VR neurosurgery based on
   open-source tools. We showcase the potential of such a framework using
   clinical data of two patients and research data of one subject. As first
   step toward practical evaluations, certified neurosurgeons positively
   assessed the VR visualizations and interactions using head-mounted
   displays. Methods and findings described in our study thus provide a
   foundation for research and development of versatile and user-friendly
   VR tools for improving neurosurgical planning and training.},

Abstract = {For patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy, neurostimulation
   offers nonpharmacological strategies to improve seizure control. Vagus
   nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamic
   nuclei, and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) are approved therapies
   which have shown efficacy in randomized shortterm trials. Controlled
   data from prospective studies are needed to confirm reports on stable or
   even increasing evidence from studies with longer follow-up and to
   confirm that neurostimulation may offer advantages also regarding
   cognitive tolerability and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
   (SUDEP)-risk. Here, a review of long-term outcomes is given,
   highlighting both achievements in terms of efficacy and tolerability and
   limitations of conclusions thereon related to an uncontrolled data basis
   and decreasing cohort sizes.

Abstract = {Increasing the accessibility of autonomous robots also for inexperienced
   users requires user-friendly and high-level control opportunities of
   robotic systems. While automated planning is able to decompose a complex
   task into a sequence of steps which reaches an intended goal, it is
   difficult to formulate such a goal without knowing the internals of the
   planning system and the exact capabilities of the robot. This becomes
   even more important in dynamic environments in which manipulable objects
   are subject to change. In this paper, we present an adaptive control
   interface which allows users to specify goals based on an internal world
   model by incrementally building referring expressions to the objects in
   the world. We consider fetch-and-carry tasks and automatically deduce
   potential high-level goals from the world model to make them available
   to the user. Based on its perceptions our system can react to changes in
   the environment by adapting the goal formulation within the
   domain-independent planning system.},

Title = {Association between seizure freedom and default mode network
   reorganization in patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy},
Journal = {EPILEPSY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {238-246},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rationale: The spontaneous synchronized activity and intrinsic
   organization of the Default Mode Network (DMN) has been found to be
   altered because of epileptic activity of temporal lobe origin. Thus, the
   aim of the present study was to compare DMN's topological properties in
   patients with seizure-free (SF) and not seizure-free (NSF) temporal lobe
   epilepsy (TLE).
   Methods: Functional connectivity within the DMN was determined from an
   8-minute resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in
   27 patients with TLE (12 SF, 15 NSF) and 15 healthy controls (HC). The
   DMN regions of interest were extracted according to the automated
   anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. Network properties were assessed using
   standard graph-theoretical measures.
   Results: Analyses revealed, irrespectively of focus lateralization,
   borderline significance for longer paths (p = 0.049) and in trend
   reduced local efficiency within the DMN of SF when compared with that of
   NSF (p = 0.075). The SF and NSF patients did not differ in global
   network topology from HC (p > 0.05). At the nodal network level, the
   degree of central hubs was significantly reduced in SF when compared
   with that in NSF (0.002 <= p <= 0.080) and HC (0.001 <= p <= 0.066)
   while simultaneously, right anterior superior temporal gyrus revealed
   significantly higher degree in SF than in NSF (p = 0.005) and HC (p =
   0.016).
   Conclusion: Seizure freedom seems to be associated with hub
   redistributions that may underlie longer paths and (in trend) reduced
   local efficiency of the network. An associated slower system response
   might reduce the probability of a rapid spread of epileptic discharges
   over the whole network and may help to prevent hypersynchronous neuronal
   activity in brain networks that may result in epileptic seizures. (C)

Abstract = {An objective performance measure for movement tasks is widely regarded
   as having utmost relevance for the therapy of movement disorders.
   Existing systems typically rely on human experts, which is known to
   produce substantial inter-and intra-rater variability. Present solutions
   are either based on simple features or invasive motion capture
   techniques. They typically work on a specific motion task only and fail
   to generalize to other tasks. In addition, they often require manual
   offline pre- and post-processing. In this paper we present a novel
   approach to compute a continuous and objective performance measure
   online during a patient session, without tedious and time-consuming pre-
   or post-processing steps. Our approach is able to generalize between
   different motion capture devices and different motion tasks. It runs on
   live motion data extracted with a non-invasive marker-less off-the-shelf
   vision-based tracking system as well as on data extracted from an
   inertial measurement unit suit. In the experiments we show that our
   approach is competitive with an offline approach as well as with the
   Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Our approach is robust with
   respect to motion execution speed and it outperforms the offline
   approach regarding movement task generalization. We show promising
   results to track the current state of a Parkinson's subject online
   during a therapy session.},

Title = {Integrity Assessment of a Hybrid DBS Probe that Enables Neurotransmitter
   Detection Simultaneously to Electrical Stimulation and Recording},
Journal = {MICROMACHINES},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a successful medical therapy for many
   treatment resistant neuropsychiatric disorders such as movement
   disorders; e.g., Parkinson's disease, Tremor, and dystonia. Moreover,
   DBS is becoming more and more appealing for a rapidly growing number of
   patients with other neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression and
   obsessive compulsive disorder. In spite of the promising outcomes, the
   current clinical hardware used in DBS does not match the technological
   standards of other medical applications and as a result could possibly
   lead to side effects such as high energy consumption and others. By
   implementing more advanced DBS devices, in fact, many of these
   limitations could be overcome. For example, a higher channels count and
   smaller electrode sites could allow more focal and tailored stimulation.
   In addition, new materials, like carbon for example, could be
   incorporated into the probes to enable adaptive stimulation protocols by
   biosensing neurotransmitters in the brain. Updating the current clinical
   DBS technology adequately requires combining the most recent
   technological advances in the field of neural engineering. Here, a novel
   hybrid multimodal DBS probe with glassy carbon microelectrodes on a
   polyimide thin-film device assembled on a silicon rubber tubing is
   introduced. The glassy carbon interface enables neurotransmitter
   detection using fast scan cyclic voltammetry and electrophysiological
   recordings while simultaneously performing electrical stimulation.
   Additionally, the presented DBS technology shows no imaging artefacts in
   magnetic resonance imaging. Thus, we present a promising new tool that
   might lead to a better fundamental understanding of the underlying
   mechanism of DBS while simultaneously paving our way towards better
   treatments.},

Abstract = {This work reports on the development and characterization of novel
   spring interconnects on polyimide electrodes array that overcome
   mechanical reliability issues of flexible substrates in implant
   assembly. The spring is composed of three arcuate beams, which start
   from a central junction and end on outer annulus boundary metal. The
   dimensions of the spring beams (each about 25 jam wide) and the central
   junction (about 25 jam in diameter) allow for Microflex bonding
   overcoming larger vertical distances provided by thicker inter-contact
   insulating gasket. These interconnections reduce the buckling and
   warpage of the flexible arrays by mechanically decoupling of the bulk
   material and the substrate. The method allows reliable
   gasket-underfilling, a crucial element for long-term electrical
   integrity of the individual electrical connections. This novel
   interconnect technology proved suitability for long-term applications
   according to MIL STD 883 testing. No open-circuits but very minor
   changes in contact resistance of spring-pads were observed during 300
   hours storage at 300 degrees C temperature (from 0.557 Omega to 0.542
   Omega) as well as after vibration tests for 144 hours (from 0.868 Omega
   to 0.865 Omega).},

Abstract = {Maintaining the insulation between adjacent electrical interconnections
   is critical for the success of active implantable medical device.
   Underfilling and globtop coating of dense arrays of microfabricated
   interconnects pose a big reliability risk. Contamination, voids and the
   difficulty to deposit liquid underfillers with the appropriate adhesive
   behavior remains a major hurdle when developing miniaturized
   high-channel neural interfaces. We approach a bottom up process to
   fabricate adhesion promoting, graded interfaces on the bottom and top
   side of polyimide-based microelectrode arrays. This allows the use of
   pre-molded silicone rubber gaskets as dry underfill material and
   silicone rubber as globtop material. In this work we present the layer
   deposition approach to solve the difficulties of providing a
   double-sided, inversely oriented layer stack for an adhering
   silicon-oxide termination on polyimide substrates. By introducing a
   sacrificial polyimide layer, we permit high temperature depositions of
   the required layers allowing a release of the fabricated stack at the
   desired interface. Long term stable silicone rubber underfill and
   overcoat is thus achievable despite the use of polyimide substrates. The
   fabricated samples showed better adhesion to silicone rubber even after
   storing in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 85 degrees C for 18 hours
   and at 60 degrees C for 72 hours. The Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectrum also revealed the integrity of the structural stack after
   detachment from the release layer. The fabrication of double side layer
   stacks increases the confidence in long term stability of interconnects
   in polyimide electrodes.},

Title = {Seizure onset predicts its type},
Journal = {EPILEPSIA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {650-660},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {ObjectiveEpilepsy is characterized by transient alterations in brain
   synchronization resulting in seizures with a wide spectrum of
   manifestations. Seizure severity and risks for patients depend on the
   evolution and spread of the hypersynchronous discharges. With standard
   visual inspection and pattern classification, this evolution could not
   be predicted early on. It is still unclear to what degree the seizure
   onset zone determines seizure severity. Such information would improve
   our understanding of ictal epileptic activity and the existing
   electroencephalogram (EEG)-based warning and intervention systems,
   providing specific reactions to upcoming seizure types. We investigate
   the possibility of predicting the future development of an epileptic
   seizure during the first seconds of recordings after their
   electrographic onset.
   MethodsBased on intracranial EEG recordings of 493 ictal events from 26
   patients with focal epilepsy, a set of 25 time and frequency domain
   features was computed using nonoverlapping 1-second time windows, from
   the first 3, 5, and 10 seconds of ictal EEG. Three random forest
   classifiers were trained to predict the future evolution of the seizure,
   distinguishing between subclinical events, focal onset aware and
   impaired awareness, and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.
   ResultsResults show that early seizure type prediction is possible based
   on a single EEG channel located in the seizure onset zone with correct
   prediction rates of 76.2 14.5\% for distinguishing subclinical
   electrographic events from clinically manifest seizures, 75 +/- 16.8\%
   for distinguishing focal onset seizures that are or are not bilateral
   tonic-clonic, and 71.4 +/- 17.2\% for distinguishing between focal onset
   seizures with or without impaired awareness. All predictions are above
   the chance level (P < .01).
   SignificanceThese findings provide the basis for developing systems for
   specific early warning of patients and health care providers, and for
   targeting EEG-based closed-loop intervention approaches to
   electrographic patterns with a high inherent risk to become clinically
   manifest.},

Title = {Brain Aging and APOE epsilon 4 Interact to Reveal Potential Neuronal
   Compensation in Healthy Older Adults},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Compensation implies the recruitment of additional neuronal resources to
   prevent the detrimental effect of age-related neuronal decline on
   cognition. Recently suggested statistical models comprise behavioral
   performance, brain activation, and measures related to aging-or
   disease-specific pathological burden to characterize compensation.
   Higher chronological age as well as the APOE epsilon 4 allele are risk
   factors for Alzheimer's disease. A more biological approach to
   characterize aging compared with chronological age is the brain age gap
   estimation (BrainAGE), taking into account structural brain
   characteristics. We utilized this estimate in an fMRI experiment
   together with APOE variant as measures related to pathological burden
   and aimed at identifying compensatory regions during working memory (WM)
   processing in a group of 34 healthy older adults. According to published
   compensation criteria, better performance along with increased brain
   activation would indicate successful compensation. We examined the
   moderating effects of BrainAGE on the relationship between task
   performance and brain activation in prefrontal cortex, as previous
   studies suggest predominantly frontal compensatory activation. Then we
   statistically compared them to the effects of chronological age (CA)
   tested in a previous study. Moreover, we examined the effects of adding
   APOE variant as a further moderator. Herewith, we strived to uncover
   neuronal compensation in healthy older adults at risk for
   neurodegenerative disease. Higher BrainAGE alone was not associated with
   an increased recruitment in prefrontal cortex. When adding APOE variant
   as a second moderator, we found an interaction of BrainAGE and APOE
   variant, such that epsilon 4 carriers recruited right inferior frontal
   gyrus with higher BrainAGE to maintain WM performance, thus showing a
   pattern compatible with successful neuronal compensation. Exploratory
   analyses yielded similar patterns in left inferior and bilateral middle
   frontal gyrus. These results contrast those from a previous study, where
   we found no indication of compensation in prefrontal cortex in epsilon 4
   carriers with increasing CA. We conclude that BrainAGE together with
   APOE variant can help to reveal potential neuronal compensation in
   healthy older adults. Previous results on neuronal compensation in
   frontal areas corroborate our findings. Compensatory brain regions could
   be targeted in affected individuals by training or stimulation protocols
   to maintain cognitive functioning as long as possible.},

   Token Test. More than 15\% damage of the slice plane through the extreme
   capsule was a strong independent predictor of aphasia in stroke
   patients, odds ratio 16.37, 95\% confidence interval: 3.11-86.16, P<

   living tissue's strong scattering properties. As such it is of
   considerable importance to utilize realistic parameters for any type of

   determined optical characteristics of diluted Intralipid solutions at
   often used, realistic volume concentrations rho(il) and at two
   wavelengths (780nm and 850nm) in a simple phantom setup featuring
   multiple sensors with different source-detector-separation (SDS) and
   penetration depths d. Both, phantom experiments and MC simulation showed
   qualitatively similar results and demonstrated the influence of the
   three major NIRS factors, namely the penetrated layer depth (d), the
   Intralipid concentration rho(il) and the source-detector separation
   (SDS). The results demonstrated that light reaching the detectors is
   inversely proportional to rho(il) and d. It corroborates the need for
   differential measurements with at least two SDS to account for
   superficial large angle scattering.},

Abstract = {Intralipid emulsion is often used as optical model substance to mimick
   living tissue's strong scattering properties. As such it is of
   considerable importance to utilize realistic parameters for any type of
   simulation or calculation in context of Near Infrared Spectroscopy. We
   determined optical properties of diluted Intralipid solutions at often
   used, realistic volume concentrations rho(il) and at two NIRS
   wavelengths (780nm and 850nm) in a double integrating Ulbricht-sphere
   setup. The results were used in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of an
   experiment, described in our companion paper. Both, phantom experiments
   and MC simulation showed qualitatively similar results and demonstrated
   the effects of changing the three major NIRS factors, namely the
   penetrated layer depth (d), the Intralipid concentration rho(il) and the
   source-detector separation (SDS). The results demonstrated that light
   reaching the detectors was inversely proportional to rho(il) and d. It
   also showed that very low Intralipid concentrations do not follow the
   optical properties documented for Intralipid 20\%.},

Abstract = {Spatio-temporally controlled drug release based on conducting polymer
   films offers a powerful technology to improve the tissue integration for
   implantable neuroprobes. We here explore the release efficiency of such
   systems in order to improve the understanding of the release mechanism
   and allow for optimized implementation of this technology into future
   drug release applications. By exposing drug loaded PEDOT coatings of
   different thicknesses to a multitude of release signals, along with
   optimizing the steps during the polymer synthesis, we could identify a
   highly reproducible electrostatically controlled drug release next to a
   slow diffusion driven release component. The release efficiency was
   moreover observed to be higher for a cyclic voltammetry signal in
   comparison to release driven by a constant potential. Biphasic current
   pulses, as used during neural stimulation, did not allow for long enough
   diffusion times to yield efficient active drug expulsion from the
   polymer films. A quantitative analysis could confirm an overall linear
   dependency between drug release and film thickness. The amount of drug
   released in response to the trigger signals was however not linearly
   correlated with the amount of charge applied. By combining these
   findings we could develop a model which accurately describes the drug
   release mechanism from a PEDOT film. The proposed model thereby points
   the way for how actively controlled, and diffusion related, release can
   be tuned for obtaining delivery dynamics tailored to specific
   applications.},

Abstract = {Implantable, closed-loop devices for automated early detection and
   stimulation of epileptic seizures are promising treatment options for
   patients with severe epilepsy that cannot be treated with traditional
   means. Most approaches for early seizure detection in the literature
   are, however, not optimized for implementation on ultra -low power
   microcontrollers required for long-term implantation. In this paper we
   present a convolutional neural network for the early detection of
   seizures from intracranial EEG signals, designed specifically for this
   purpose. In addition, we investigate approximations to comply with
   hardware limits while preserving accuracy. We compare our approach to
   three previously proposed convolutional neural networks and a
   feature-based SVM classifier with respect to detection accuracy, latency
   and computational needs. Evaluation is based on a comprehensive database
   with long-term EEG recordings. The proposed method outperforms the other
   detectors with a median sensitivity of 0.96, false detection rate of
   10.1 per hour and median detection delay of 3.7 seconds, while being the
   only approach suited to be realized on a low power microcontroller due
   to its parsimonious use of computational and memory resources.},

Abstract = {y Densely connected networks for classification enable feature
   exploration and result in state-of-the-art performance on multiple
   classification tasks. The alternative to dense networks is the residual
   network which enables feature reusage. In this work, we combine these
   orthogonal concepts for encoder-decoder architectures, which we call
   Dual-Path DenseBlock Network (DPDB-Net). We introduce a dense block
   which incorporates feature re-usage and new feature exploration in the
   encoder. Moreover, we discuss that feature re-usage by the residual
   network architecture leads to a feature map explosion in the decoder
   and, thus, is not advantageous in this part of the network. We evaluated
   our proposed architecture in multiple segmentation tasks and report
   state-of-the-art performance on the Freiburg Forest dataset and
   competitive results on the CamVid dataset.},

Title = {Medial forebrain bundle DBS differentially modulates dopamine release in
   the nucleus accumbens in a rodent model of depression},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {327},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Medial forebrain bundle (MFB) deep brain stimulation (DBS)
   has anti-depressant effects clinically and in depression models.
   Currently, therapeutic mechanisms of MFB DBS or how stimulation
   parameters acutely impact neurotransmitter release, particularly
   dopamine, are unknown. Experimentally, MFB DBS has been shown to evoke
   dopamine response in healthy controls, but not yet in a rodent model of
   depression.
   Objective: The study investigated the impact of clinically used
   stimulation parameters on the dopamine induced response in a validated
   rodent depression model and in healthy controls.
   Method: The stimulation-induced dopamine response in Flinders Sensitive
   Line (FSL, n = 6) rat model of depression was compared with Sprague
   Dawley (SD, n = 6) rats following MFB DSB, using Fast Scan Cyclic
   Voltammetry to assess the induced response in the nucleus accumbens.
   Stimulation parameters were 130 Hz ({''}clinically{''} relevant) with
   pulse widths between 100 and 350 mu s.
   Results: Linear mixed model analysis showed significant impact in both
   models following MFB DBS both at 130 and 60 Hz with 100 mu s pulse width
   in inducing dopamine response. Furthermore, at 130 Hz the evoked
   dopamine responses were different across the groups at the different
   pulse widths.
   Conclusion: The differential impact of MFB DBS on the induced dopamine
   response, including different response patterns at given pulse widths,
   is suggestive of physiological and anatomical divergence in the MFB in
   the pathological and healthy state. Studying how varying stimulation
   parameters affect the physiological outcome will promote a better
   understanding of the biological substrate of the disease and the
   possible anti-depressant mechanisms at play in clinical MFB DBS.},

Abstract = {As research becomes more and more data intensive, managing this data
   becomes a major challenge in any organization. At university level there
   is seldom a unified data management system in place. The general
   approach to storing data in such environments is to deploy network
   storage. Each member can store their data organized to their own likings
   in their dedicated location on the network. Additionally, users tend to
   store data in distributed manner such as on private devices, portable
   storage, or public and private repositories. Adding to this complexity,
   it is common for university departments to have high fluctuation of
   staff, resulting in major loss of information and data on an employee's
   departure. A common scenario then is that it is known that certain data
   has already been created via experiments or simulation. However, it can
   not be retrieved, resulting in a repetition of generation, which is
   costly and time-consuming. Additionally, as of recent years, publishers
   and funding agencies insist on storing, sharing, and reusing existing
   research data. We show how digital preservation can help group leaders
   and their employees cope with these issues, by introducing our own
   archival system OntoRAIS.},

Abstract = {OCT has been demonstrated as an efficient imaging modality in various
   biomedical and clinical applications. However, there is a missing link
   with respect to the source of contrast between OCT and other modern
   imaging modalities, no quantitative comparison has been demonstrated
   between them, yet. We evaluated, to our knowledge, for the first time in
   vivo OCT measurement of rat brain with our previously proposed forward
   imaging method by both qualitatively and quantitatively correlating OCT
   with the corresponding T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance
   images, fiber density map (FDM), and two types of histology staining
   (cresyl violet and acetylcholinesterase AchE), respectively. Brain
   anatomical structures were identified and compared across OCT, MRI and
   histology imaging modalities. Noticeable resemblances corresponding to
   certain anatomical structures were found between OCT and other image
   profiles. Correlation was quantitatively assessed by estimating
   correlation coefficient (R) and mutual information (MI). Results show
   that the 1-D OCT measurements in regards to the intensity profile and
   estimated attenuation factor, do not have profound linear correlation
   with the other image modalities suggested from correlation coefficient
   estimation. However, findings in mutual information analysis demonstrate
   that there are markedly high MI values in OCT-MRI signals. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Neural microelectrodes are well established tools for delivering
   therapeutic electrical pulses, and recording neural electrophysiological
   signals. However, long term implanted neural probes often become
   functionally impaired by tissue encapsulation. At present, analyzing
   this immune reaction is only feasible with post-mortem histology;
   currently no means for specific in vivo monitoring exist and most
   applicable imaging modalities provide no sufficient resolution for a
   cellular measurement in deep brain regions. Optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) is a well developed imaging modality, providing cellular
   resolution and up to 1.2 mm imaging depth in brain tissue. Further more,
   a fiber based spectral domain OCT was shown to be capable of minimally
   invasive brain intervention. In the present study, we propose to use a
   fiber based spectral domain OCT to monitor the the progression of the
   tissue's immune response and scar encapsulation of microprobes in a rat
   animal model. We developed an integrated OCT fiber catheter consisting
   of an implantable ferrule based fiber cannula and a fiber patch cable.
   The fiber cannula was 18.5 mm long, including a 10.5 mm ceramic ferrule
   and a 8.0 mm long, 0 125 pm single mode fiber. A mating sleeve was used
   to fix and connect the fiber cannula to the OCT fiber cable. Light
   attenuation between the OCT fiber cable and the fiber cannula through
   the mating sleeve was measured and minimized. The fiber cannula was
   implanted in rat brain together with a microelectrode in sight used as a
   foreign body to induce the brain tissue immune reaction. Preliminary
   data showed a significant enhancement of the OCT backscattering signal
   during the brain tissue scarring process, while the OCT signal of the
   flexible microelectrode was getting weaker consequentially.},

Title = {Dissociation of visual extinction and neglect in the left hemisphere},
Journal = {CORTEX},

Volume = {129},
Pages = {211-222},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Visual neglect and extinction are two distinct visuospatial attention
   deficits that frequently occur after right hemisphere cerebral stroke.
   However, their different lesion profiles remain a matter of debate. In
   the left hemisphere, a domain-general dual-loop model with distinct
   computational abilities onto which several cognitive functions may
   project, has been proposed: a dorsal stream for sensori-motor mapping in
   time and space and a ventral stream for comprehension and representation
   of concepts. We wondered whether such a distinction may apply to visual
   extinction and neglect in left hemisphere lesions. Of 165 prospectively
   studied patients with acute left hemispheric ischemic stroke with a
   single lesion on MRI, 122 had no visuospatial attention deficit, 10 had
   extinction, 31 neglect and 2 had both, visual extinction and neglect.
   Voxel-based-lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM, FDR<.05) showed a clear
   anatomical dissociation. Extinction occurred after damage to the
   parietal cortex (anterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus, inferior
   parietal lobe, and supramarginal gyrus), while visual neglect occurred
   after damage mainly to the temporal lobe (superior and middle temporal
   lobe, anterior temporal pole), inferior ventral premotor cortex, frontal
   operculum, angular gyrus, and insula. Direct comparison of both
   conditions linked extinction to intraparietal sulcus and supramarginal
   gyrus (FDR<.05). Thus, in the left hemisphere extinction seems to be
   related to dorsal stream lesions, whereas neglect maps more on the
   ventral stream. These data cannot be generalized to the right
   hemi-sphere. However, a domain-general point-of-view may stimulate
   discussion on visuospa-tial attention processing also in the right
   hemisphere. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Pouring is a fundamental skill for robots in both domestic and
   industrial environments. Ideally, a robot should be able to pour with
   high accuracy to specific, pre-defined heights and without spilling.
   However, due to the complex dynamics of liquids, it is difficult to
   learn how to pour to achieve these goals. In this paper we present an
   approach to learn a policy for pouring using Deep Deterministic Policy
   Gradients (DDPG). We remove the need for collecting training experiences
   on a real robot, by using a state-of-the-art liquid simulator, which
   allows for learning the liquid dynamics. We show through our
   experiments, performed with a PR2 robot, that it is possible to
   successfully transfer the learned policy to a real robot and even apply
   it to different liquids.},

Abstract = {Nanostructured materials exhibit large electrochemical surface areas and
   are thus of high interest for neural interfaces where low impedance and
   high charge transfer characteristics are desired. While progress in
   nanotechnology successively enabled smaller feature sizes and thus
   improved electrochemical properties, concerns were raised with respect
   to the mechanical stability of such nano structures for use in neural
   applications. In our study we address these concerns by investigating
   the mechanical and electrochemical stability of nanostructured platinum.
   Neural probes with nano Pt were exposed to exaggerated stress tests
   resembling insertion into neural tissue over 60 mm distance or long-term
   stimulation over 240 M biphasic current pulses. Thereby only
   insignificant changes in electrochemical properties and morphological
   appearance could be observed in response to the test, proving that
   nanostructured platinum exhibits outstanding stability. With this
   finding, a major concern in using nanostructured materials for
   interfacing neural tissue could be eliminated, demonstrating the high

Abstract = {The exact spatial distribution of impaired cerebral autoregulation in
   carotid artery disease is unknown. In this pilot study, we present a new
   approach of multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (mcNIRS) for
   noninvasive spatial mapping of dynamic autoregulation in carotid artery
   disease. In 15 patients with unilateral severe carotid artery stenosis
   or occlusion, cortical hemodynamics in the bilateral frontal cortex were
   assessed from changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration using 52-channel
   NIRS (spatial resolution similar to 2 cm). Dynamic autoregulation was
   graded by the phase shift between respiratory-induced 0.1 Hz
   oscillations of blood pressure and oxyhemoglobin. Ten of 15 patients
   showed regular phase values in the expected (patho) physiological range.
   Five patients had clearly outlying irregular phase values mostly due to
   artifacts. In patients with a regular phase pattern, a significant
   side-to-side difference of dynamic autoregulation was observed for the
   cortical border zone area between the middle and anterior cerebral
   artery (p < 0.05). In conclusion, dynamic cerebral autoregulation can be
   spatially assessed from slow hemodynamic oscillations with mcNIRS. In
   high-grade carotid artery disease, cortical dynamic autoregulation is
   affected mostly in the vascular border zone. Spatial mapping of dynamic
   autoregulation may serve as a powerful tool for identifying brain
   regions at specific risks for hemodynamic infarction. (C) The Authors.

Abstract = {As autonomous service robots become more affordable and thus available
   also for the general public, there is a growing need for user friendly
   interfaces to control the robotic system. Currently available control
   modalities typically expect users to be able to express their desire
   through either touch, speech or gesture commands. While this requirement
   is fulfilled for the majority of users, paralyzed users may not be able
   to use such systems. In this paper, we present a novel framework, that
   allows these users to interact with a robotic service assistant in a
   closed-loop fashion, using only thoughts. The brain-computer interface
   (BCI) system is composed of several interacting components, i.e.,
   non-invasive neuronal signal recording and decoding, high-level task
   planning, motion and manipulation planning as well as environment
   perception. In various experiments, we demonstrate its applicability and
   robustness in real world scenarios, considering fetch-and-carry tasks
   and tasks involving human-robot interaction. As our results demonstrate,
   our system is capable of adapting to frequent changes in the environment
   and reliably completing given tasks within a reasonable amount of time.
   Combined with high-level planning and autonomous robotic systems,
   interesting new perspectives open up for non-invasive BCI-based
   human-robot interactions.},

   Implementation of Seizure Detection},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {The closed-loop application of electrical stimulation via chronically
   implanted electrodes is a novel approach to stop seizures in patients
   with focal-onset epilepsy. To this end, an energy efficient seizure
   detector that can be implemented in an implantable device is of crucial
   importance. In this study, we first evaluated the performance of two
   machine learning algorithms (Random Forest classifier and support vector
   machine (SVM)) by using selected time and frequency domain features with
   a limited need of computational resources. Performance of the algorithms
   was further compared to a detection strategy implemented in an existing
   closed loop neurostimulation device for the treatment of epilepsy. The
   results show a superior performance of the Random Forest classifier
   compared to the SVM classifier and the reference approach. Next, we
   implemented the feature extraction and classification process of the
   Random Forest classifier on a microcontroller to evaluate the energy
   efficiency of this seizure detector. In conclusion, the feature set in
   combination with Random Forest classifier is an energy efficient
   hardware implementation that shows an improvement of detection
   sensitivity and specificity compared to the presently available
   closed-loop intervention in epilepsy while preserving a low detection
   delay.},

Title = {Modular Current Stimulation System for Pre-clinical Studies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Electric stimulators with precise and reliable outputs are an
   indispensable part of electrophysiological research. From single cells
   to deep brain or neuromuscular tissue, there are diverse targets for
   electrical stimulation. Even though commercial systems are available, we
   state the need for a low-cost, high precision, functional, and modular
   (hardware, firmware, and software) current stimulation system with the
   capacity to generate stable and complex waveforms for pre-clinical
   research. The system presented in this study is a USB controlled
   4-channel modular current stimulator that can be expanded and generate
   biphasic arbitrary waveforms with 16-bit resolution, high temporal
   precision (mu s), and passive charge balancing: the NES STiM (Neuro
   Electronic Systems Stimulator). We present a detailed description of the
   system's structural design, the controlling software, reliability test,
   and the pre-clinical studies {[}deep brain stimulation (DBS) in hemi-PD
   rat model] in which it was utilized. The NES STiM has been tested with
   MacOS and Windows operating systems. Interfaces to MATLAB source codes
   are provided. The system is inexpensive, relatively easy to build and
   can be assembled quickly. We hope that the NES STiM will be used in a
   wide variety of neurological applications such as Functional Electrical
   Stimulation (FES), DBS and closed loop neurophysiological research.},

Abstract = {We apply convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to the task of
   distinguishing pathological from normal EEG recordings in the Temple
   University Hospital EEG Abnormal Corpus. We use two basic, shallow and
   deep ConvNet architectures recently shown to decode task-related
   information from EEG at least as well as established algorithms designed
   for this purpose. In decoding EEG pathology, both ConvNets reached
   substantially better accuracies (about 6\% better, approximate to 85\%)
   than the only published result for this dataset, and were still better
   when using only 1 minute of each recording for training and only six
   seconds of each recording for testing. We used automated methods to
   optimize architectural hyperparameters and found intriguingly different
   ConvNet architectures, e.g., with max pooling as the only nonlinearity.
   Visualizations of the ConvNet decoding behavior showed that they used
   spectral power changes in the delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz)
   frequency range, possibly alongside other features, consistent with
   expectations derived from spectral analysis of the EEG data and from the
   textual medical reports. Analysis of the textual medical reports also
   highlighted the potential fur accuracy increases by integrating
   contextual information, such as the age of subjects. In summary, the
   ConvNets and visualization techniques used in this study constitute a
   next step towards clinically useful automated EEG diagnosis and
   establish a new baseline for future work on this topic.},

Abstract = {Multi-modal devices combining several recording and stimulation
   techniques like optical and electrophysiological ones become more and

   providing high transparency and stability are required. Therefore,
   mechanical and electrochemical improvement of the transparent and highly
   conductive material indium-tin-oxide (ITO) was studied to examine future
   application in chronic implantable systems. Accelerated aging in vitro
   showed a possible sub-chronical operational time, whereas the ITO phase
   boundary underwent a transition from capacitive behavior to a Warburg
   impedance. Furthermore, an additional transparent adhesion layer of
   silicon carbide (SiC) between the polyimide substrate and the ITO layer
   was integrated. This greatly enhanced the thermal and mechanical
   stability of ITO on the flexible substrate, which enable many
   possibilities for future manufacturing processes and applications.},

Abstract = {Stable interconnection to neurons in vivo over long time-periods is
   critical for the success of future advanced neuroelectronic
   applications. The inevitable foreign body reaction towards implanted
   materials challenges the stability and an active intervention strategy
   would be desirable to treat inflammation locally. Here, we investigate
   whether controlled release of the anti-inflammatory drug Dexamethasone
   from flexible neural microelectrodes in the rat hippocampus has an
   impact on probe-tissue integration over 12 weeks of implantation. The
   drug was stored in a conducting polymer coating (PEDOT/Dex), selectively
   deposited on the electrode sites of neural probes, and released on
   weekly basis by applying a cyclic voltammetry signal in three electrode
   configuration in fully awake animals. Dex-functionalized probes provided
   stable recordings and impedance characteristics over the entire chronic
   study. Histological evaluation after 12 weeks of implantation revealed
   an overall low degree of inflammation around all flexible probes whereas
   electrodes exposed to active drug release protocols did have neurons
   closer to the electrode sites compared to controls. The combination of
   flexible probe technology with anti-inflammatory coatings accordingly
   offers a promising approach for enabling long-term stable neural
   interfaces. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this work was to analyze the intrinsic diffusion
   sensitivity of the balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging
   sequence, meaning the observation of diffusion-induced attenuation of
   the bSSFP steady-state signal due to the imaging gradients. Although
   these diffusion effects are usually neglected for most clinical gradient
   systems, such strong gradient systems are employed for high resolution
   imaging of small animals or MR Microscopy. The impact on the bSSFP
   signal of the imaging gradients characterized by their b-values was
   analyzed with simulations and experiments at a 7T animal scanner using a
   gradient system with maximum gradient amplitude of approx. 700mT/m. It
   was found that the readout gradients have a stronger impact on the
   attenuation than the phase encoding gradients. Also, as the PE gradients
   are varying with each repetition interval, the diffusion effects induce
   strong modulations of the bSSFP signal over the sequence repetition
   cycles depending on the phase encoding gradient table. It is shown that
   a signal gain can be obtained through a change of flip angle as a new
   optimal flip angle maximizing the signal can be defined. The dependency
   of the diffusion effects on relaxation times and b-values were explored
   with simulations. The attenuation increases with T-2. In conclusion,
   diffusion attenuation of the bSSFP signal becomes significant for high
   resolution imaging voxel size (roughly < 100 m) of long T-2 substances.

Title = {Chronically Implanted Microelectrodes Cause c-fos Expression Along Their
   Trajectory},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {When designing electrodes and probes for brain-machine interfaces, one
   of the challenges faced involves minimizing the brain-tissue response,
   which would otherwise create an environment that is detrimental for the
   accurate functioning of such probes. Following the implantation process,
   the brain reacts with a sterile inflammation response and resulting
   astrocytic glial scar formation, potentially resulting in neuronal cell
   loss around the implantation site. Such alterations in the naive brain
   tissue can hinder both the quality of neuronal recordings, and the
   efficacy of deep-brain stimulation. In this study, we chronically
   implanted a glass-supported polyimide microelectrode in the dorsolateral
   striatum of Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect of high-frequency
   stimulation (HFS) was investigated using c-fos immunoreactivity
   techniques. GFAP and ED1 immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the
   brain-tissue response. No changes in c-fos expression were found for
   either the acute or chronic stimulus groups; although a c-fos expression
   was found along the length of the implantation trajectory, following
   chronic implantation of our stiffened polyimide microelectrode.
   Furthermore, we also observed the formation of a glial scar around the
   microelectrode, with an accompanying low number of inflammation cells.
   Histological and statistical analysis of NeuN-positive cells did not
   demonstrate a pronounced ``kill zone{''} with accompanying neuronal cell
   death around the implantation site, neither on the polymer side, nor on
   the glass side of the PI-glass probe.},

Abstract = {We investigate the optical emission properties of the active InGaN shell
   of high aspect-ratio InGaN/GaN core-shell microrods (mu Rods) by
   confocal quasi-resonant polarization-resolved and excitation density
   dependent micro-photoluminescence (mu PL). The active shell, multiple
   thin InGaN/GaN quantum wells (MQWs), was deposited on GaN mu Rods
   selectively grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy on patterned
   SiO2/n-GaN/sapphire template. High spatial resolution mappings reveal a
   very homogeneous emission intensity along the whole mu Rods including
   the tip despite a red-shift of 30 nm from the base to the tip along the
   8.6 mu m-long m-plane sidewalls. Looking at the Fabry-Perot interference
   fringes superimposed on the mu PL spectra, we get structural information
   on the mu Rods. A high degree of linear polarization (DLP) of 0.6-0.66
   is measured on the lower half of the m-plane side facets with a slight
   decrease toward the tip. We observe the typical drop of the DLP with an
   excitation density caused by degenerate filling of valence bands (Fermi
   regime). Local internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) of 55 +/- 11\% up to
   73 +/- 7\% are estimated on the m-plane facet from measurements at low
   temperature. Finally, simultaneously fitting the DLP and IQE as a
   function of the excitation density, we determine the carrier density
   inside the active region and the recombination rate coefficients of the
   m-plane MQWs. We show that phase-space filling and the background
   carrier density have to be included in the recombination rate model.

Abstract = {We investigate, via temperature and excitation density dependent

   metal organic vapor phase epitaxy on patterned SiO2/n-GaN/sapphire

   analyzed by mappings along the m-plane facet of the microrods in order
   to get insight on the growth mechanisms of the shell. Excitation density
   dependent measurements show that the IQE is affected by the high doping
   level of the core, which is required to grow such high aspect-ratio
   structures. Local IQEs between 15+/-61\% near the tip and 44+/-65\% near
   the base of microrods are estimated from measurements at room and low

Abstract = {We study the end-to-end steering problem using visual input data from an
   onboard vehicle camera. An empirical comparison between spatial,
   spatio-temporal and multimodal models is performed assessing each
   concept's performance from two points of evaluation. First, how close
   the model is in predicting and imitating a real-life driver's behavior,
   second, the smoothness of the predicted steering command. The latter is
   a newly proposed metric. Building on our results, we propose a new
   recurrent multimodal model. The suggested model has been tested on a
   custom dataset recorded by BMW, as well as the public dataset provided
   by Udacity. Results show that it outperforms previously released scores.
   Further, a steering correction concept from off-lane driving through the
   inclusion of correction frames is presented. We show that our suggestion
   leads to promising results empirically.},

Abstract = {Measuring the strength of directed functional interactions between brain
   regions is fundamental to understand neural networks. Functional
   near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a suitable method to map directed
   interactions between brain regions but is based on the neurovascular
   coupling. It, thus, relies on vasomotor reactivity and is potentially
   biased by non-neural physiological noise. To investigate the impact of
   physiological noise on fNIRS-based estimates of directed functional
   connectivity within the rostro-caudal hierarchical organization of the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC), we systematically assessed the effects of
   pathological perturbations of vasomotor reactivity and of externally
   triggered arterial blood pressure (aBP) fluctuations. Fifteen patients
   with unilateral stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) underwent
   multi-channel fNIRS during rest and during metronomic breathing,
   inducing aBP oscillations at 0.1 Hz. Comparisons between the healthy and
   pathological hemispheres served as quasi-experimental manipulation of
   the neurovascular system's capability for vasomotor reactivity.
   Comparisons between rest and breathing served as experimental
   manipulation of two different levels of physiological noise that were
   expected to differ between healthy and pathological hemispheres. In the
   hemisphere affected by ICA stenosis, the rostro-caudal hierarchical
   organization of the PFC was compromised reflecting the pathological
   effect on the vascular and neural level. Breathing-induced aBP
   oscillations biased the magnitude of directed interactions in the PFC,
   but could be adjusted using either the aBP time series (intra-individual
   approach) or the aBP-induced fNIRS signal variance (inter-individual
   approach). Multi-channel fNIRS, hence, provides a sound basis for
   analyses of directed functional connectivity as potential bias due to
   physiological noise can be effectively controlled for.},

Abstract = {Studying rodent behavior within virtual worlds and their interaction
   with them is a fairly new field of research. While virtual reality is
   able to visually present an unlimited variety of worlds to the animal
   with ease, physical stimulation often remains unsatisfactory and is
   usually difficult to achieve. Rodents such as rats mainly experience
   their environment using their whiskers. Though, electrical stimulation
   using subcortical electrode implants have been successfully used for
   sensory stimulation, the underlying principles are still poorly
   understood. One possible and less invasive alternative method is
   physical stimulation of the whiskers using puffs of air with the added
   benefit of avoiding the overall risks of brain surgery for intracranial
   microstimulation.},

Title = {Functionally dissociating ventro-dorsal components within the
   rostro-caudal hierarchical organization of the human prefrontal cortex},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {185},
Pages = {398-407},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Cognitive control is proposed to rely on a rostral-to-caudal hierarchy
   of neural processing within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with more
   rostral parts exerting control over more caudal parts. Anatomical and
   functional data suggest that this hierarchical organization of the PFC
   may be separated into a ventral and a dorsal component. Furthermore,
   recent studies indicate that the apex of the hierarchy resides within
   the mid-lateral rather the rostral PFC. However, investigating the
   hierarchical aspect of rostro-to-caudal processing requires
   quantification of the directed interactions between PFC regions.
   Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in a sample of
   healthy young adults we analyzed directed interactions between rostral
   and caudal PFC during passive watching of nature documentaries. Directed
   coherence (DC) as a measure of directed interaction was computed
   pairwise between 38 channels evenly distributed over the lateral
   prefrontal convexity.
   Results revealed an overall predominance of rostral-to-caudal directed
   interactions in the PFC that further dissociated along a ventro-dorsal
   axis: Dorsal regions exerted stronger rostro-caudally directed
   interactions on dorsal than on ventral regions and vice versa.
   Interactions between ventral and dorsal PFC were stronger from ventral
   to dorsal areas than vice versa. Results further support the notion that
   the mid-dorsolateral PFC constitutes the apex of the prefrontal
   hierarchy.
   Taken together these data provide novel evidence for parallel dorsal and
   ventral streams within the rostrocaudal hierarchical organization of the
   PFC. FNIRS-based analyses of directed interactions put forward a new
   perspective on the functional architecture of the prefrontal hierarchy
   and complement previous insights from functional magnetic resonance
   imaging.},

Abstract = {In order to provide active neural needle probes with a large number of
   recordings sites integrated on a single shank, a high degree of
   miniaturization of the probe shank and its electronics is required. This
   work presents a probe which comprises 160 recording sites each combined
   with a low-noise amplifier integrated under each electrode in an area of
   only 50x80 mu m(2). In total, 32 channels can be monitored
   simultaneously by means of 32 12-bit incremental Delta-Sigma ADCs each
   requiring an area of 120x40 mu m(2). The selection of the 32 channels is
   performed by means of a digital controller. The average input referred
   noise for AP signals (300 Hz to 10 kHz) is extracted to 20.87 mu Vrms in
   in-vitro measurements. The design competes well with the state of the
   art due to a maximum shank width of 200 mu m, an area of 0.032 mm(2),
   and a power consumption of 26.5 mu W per channel.},

Title = {Interaction between cognitive reserve and age moderates effect of lesion
   load on stroke outcome},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {The concepts of brain reserve and cognitive reserve were recently
   suggested as valuable predictors of stroke outcome. To test this
   hypothesis, we used age, years of education and lesion size as
   clinically feasible coarse proxies of brain reserve, cognitive reserve,
   and the extent of stroke pathology correspondingly. Linear and logistic
   regression models were used to predict cognitive outcome (Montreal
   Cognitive Assessment) and stroke-induced impairment and disability (NIH
   Stroke Scale; modified Rankin Score) in a sample of 104 chronic stroke
   patients carefully controlled for potential confounds. Results revealed
   46\% of explained variance for cognitive outcome (p<0.001) and yielded a
   significant three-way interaction: Larger lesions did not lead to
   cognitive impairment in younger patients with higher education, but did
   so in younger patients with lower education. Conversely, even small
   lesions led to poor cognitive outcome in older patients with lower
   education, but didn't in older patients with higher education. We
   observed comparable three-way interactions for clinical scores of
   stroke-induced impairment and disability both in the acute and chronic
   stroke phase. In line with the hypothesis, years of education conjointly
   with age moderated effects of lesion on stroke outcome. This
   non-additive effect of cognitive reserve suggests its post-stroke
   protective impact on stroke outcome.},

Title = {Large Vessel Occlusion in Acute Stroke Cortical Symptoms Are More

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-To date, no clinical score has become widely
   accepted as an eligible prehospital marker for large vessel occlusion
   (LVO) and the need of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in ischemic stroke.
   On the basis of pathophysiological considerations, we propose that
   cortical symptoms such as aphasia and neglect are more sensitive
   indicators for LVO and MT than motor deficits.
   Methods-We, thus, retrospectively evaluated a consecutive cohort of 543
   acute stroke patients including patients with ischemia in the posterior
   circulation, hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, and stroke
   mimics to best represent the prehospital setting.
   Results-Cortical symptoms alone showed to be a reliable indicator for
   LVO (sensitivity: 0.91; specificity: 0.70) and MT (sensitivity: 0.90;
   specificity: 0.60) in acute stroke patients, whereas motor deficits
   showed a sensitivity of 0.85 for LVO (specificity: 0.53) and 0.87 for MT
   (specificity: 0.48).
   Conclusions-We propose that in the prehospital setting, the presence of
   cortical symptoms is a reliable indicator for LVO and its presence
   justifies transportation to an MT-capable center.},

Title = {Systematic Evaluation of DBS Parameters in the Hemi-Parkinsonian Rat
   Model},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is clinically
   employed to ameliorate several symptoms of manifest Parkinson's Disease
   (PD). Stimulation parameters utilized by chronically implanted pulse
   generators comprise biphasic rectangular short (60-100 mu s) pulses with
   a repetition frequency between 130 and 180 Hz. A better insight into the
   effect of electrical stimulation parameters could potentially reveal new
   possibilities for the improvement of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a
   treatment. To this end, we employed single-sided 6-hydroxidopamine
   (6-OHDA) lesioning of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in rats to
   systematically investigate alternative stimulation parameters. These
   hemi-parkinsonian (hemi-PD) rats underwent individualized, ipsilateral
   electrical stimulation to the STN of the lesioned hemisphere, while the
   transiently induced contralateral rotational behavior was quantified to
   assess the effect of DBS parameter variations. The number of induced
   rotations during 30 s of stimulation was strongly correlated with the
   amplitude of the stimulation pulses. Despite a general linear relation
   between DBS frequency and rotational characteristics, a plateau effect
   was observed in the rotation count throughout the clinically used
   frequency range. Alternative waveforms to the conventional biphasic
   rectangular (Rect) pulse shapes {[}Triangular (Tri), Sinusoidal (Sine),
   and Sawtooth (Lin.Dec.)] required higher charges per phase to display
   similar behavior in rats as compared to the conventional pulse shape.
   The Euclidean Distance (ED) was used to quantify similarities between
   different angular trajectories. Overall, our study confirmed that the
   effect of different amplitude and frequency parameters of STN-DBS in the
   hemi-PD rat model was similar to those in human PD patients. This shows
   that induced contralateral rotation is a valuable readout in testing
   stimulation parameters. Our study supports the call for more
   pre-clinical studies using this measurement to assess the effect of
   other DBS parameters such as pulse-width and interphase intervals.},

Abstract = {The possibility to release drugs from conducting polymers, like
   polypyrrole or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), has been
   described and investigated for a variety of different substances during
   the last years, showing a wide interest in these release systems. A
   point that has not been looked at so far however is the possibility of
   other substances, next to the intended ones, leaving the polymer film
   under the high voltage excursions during redox sweeping. In this study
   we target this weakness of commonly used detection methods by
   implementing a high precision analytical method (high-performance liquid
   chromatography) that allows a separation and subsequently a detailed
   quantification of all possible release products. We could identify a
   significantly more complex release behavior for a PEDOT:Dex system than
   has been assumed so far, revealing the active release of the monomer
   upon redox activation. The released EDOT could thereby be shown to
   result from the bulk material, causing a considerable loss of polymer
   (>10\% during six release events) that could partly account for the
   observed degradation or delamination effects of drug-eluting coatings.
   The monomer leakage was found to be substantially higher for a PEDOT:Dex
   film compared to a PEDOT:PSS sample. This finding indicates an
   overestimation of drug release if side products are mistaken for the
   actual drug mass. Moreover the full picture of released substances
   implements the need for further studies to reduce the monomer leakage
   and identify possible adverse effects, especially in the perspective of
   releasing an anti-inflammatory substance for attenuation of the foreign
   body reaction toward implanted electrodes. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {High signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the NMR signal has always been a key
   target that drives massive research effort in many fields. Among several
   parameters, a high filling factor of the MR coil has proven to boost the
   SNR. In case of small-volume samples, a high filling factor and thus a
   high SNR can be achieved through miniaturizing the MR coil. However,
   under certain circumstances, this can be impractical. In this paper, we
   present an extensive theoretical and experimental investigation of the
   inductively coupled LC resonator and the magnetic Lenz lens as two
   candidate approaches that can enhance the SNR in such circumstances. The
   results demonstrate that the narrow-band LC resonator is superior in
   terms of SNR, while the non-tuned nature of the Lenz lens makes it
   preferable in broadband applications.},

Abstract = {Brain stimulation is increasingly used in epilepsy patients with
   insufficient therapeutic response to pharmacological treatment. Whereas
   vagus nerve stimulation with implanted devices has been used in large

   the latest vagus nerve stimulators are intended to stimulate during the

   severity. Furthermore, transcutaneous stimulation approaches are now
   available, although their efficacy remains uncertain. This review
   explains the concepts underlying brain stimulation, provides an overview

   assessed for several standard MRI sequences and implant orientations in
   phantom experiments and compared to common clinical localization
   procedures.Main results.A localization precision of 0.41 +/- 0.20 mm
   could be achieved for both electrode diameters compared to 1.46 +/- 0.69
   mm that was achieved for 4 mm standard electrode contacts localized
   using a common clinical standard method. The new reference structures
   are intrinsically bio-compatible, and they can be detected with
   currently available feature detection software so that a clinical
   implementation of this technology should be
   feasible.Significance.Neuropathologies are increasingly diagnosed and
   treated with subdural electrodes, where the exact localization of the
   electrode contacts with respect to the patient's cortical anatomy is a
   prerequisite for the procedure. Post-implantation electrode localization
   using MRI may be advantageous compared to the common alternative of
   CT-MRI image co-registration, as it avoids systematic localization
   errors associated with the co-registration itself, as well as brain
   shift and implant movement. Additionally, MRI provides superior soft
   tissue contrast for the identification of brain lesions without exposing
   the patient to ionizing radiation. Recent studies show that smaller
   electrodes and high-density electrode grids are ideal for clinical and
   research purposes, but the localization of these devices in MRI has not
   been demonstrated.},

Title = {Fine-grained mapping of mouse brain functional connectivity with

Abstract = {Understanding the intrinsic circuit-level functional organization of the
   brain has benefited tremendously from the advent of resting-state fMRI
   (rsfMRI). In humans, resting-state functional network has been
   consistently mapped and its alterations have been shown to correlate
   with symptomatology of various neurological or psychiatric disorders. To
   date, deciphering the mouse brain functional connectivity (MBFC) with
   rsfMRI remains a largely underexplored research area, despite the
   plethora of human brain disorders that can be modeled in this specie. To
   pave the way from pre-clinical to clinical investigations we
   characterized here the intrinsic architecture of mouse brain functional
   circuitry, based on rsfMRI data acquired at 7 T using the Cryoprobe
   technology. High-dimensional spatial group independent component
   analysis demonstrated fine-grained segregation of cortical and
   subcortical networks into functional clusters, overlapping with high
   specificity onto anatomical structures, down to single gray matter
   nuclei. These clusters, showing a high level of stability and
   reliability in their patterning, formed the input elements for computing
   the MBFC network using partial correlation and graph theory. Its
   topological architecture conserved the fundamental characteristics
   described for the human and rat brain, such as small-worldness and
   partitioning into functional modules. Our results additionally showed
   inter-modular interactions via ``network hubs{''}. Each major functional
   system (motor, somatosensory, limbic, visual, autonomic) was found to
   have representative hubs that might play an important input/output role
   and form a functional core for information integration. Moreover, the
   rostro-dorsal hippocampus formed the highest number of relevant
   connections with other brain areas, highlighting its importance as core
   structure for MBFC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objective. Electrochemical microsensors based on noble metals can give
   essential information on their microenvironment with high
   spatio-temporal resolution. However, most advanced chemo- and biosensors
   lack the long-term stability for physiological monitoring of brain
   tissue beyond an acute application. Noble metal electrodes are widely
   used as neural interfaces, particularly for stimulating in the central
   nervous system. Our goal was to recruit already deployed, unmodified
   noble metal electrodes (Pt, Pt/Ir) as in situ chemical sensors.
   Approach. With advanced electrochemical sensor methods, we investigated
   electrode surface processes, oxidizable species and oxygen as an
   indicator for tissue mass transport. We developed a unique, multi-step,
   amperometric/potentiometric sensing procedure derived from the
   investigation of Pt surface processes by chronocoulometry providing
   fundamental characterization of the electrode itself. Main results. The
   resulting electrochemical protocol preconditions the electrode, measures
   oxidizable and reducible species, and the open circuit potential (OCP).
   A linear, stable sensor performance was demonstrated, also in the
   presence of proteins, validating signal stability of our cyclic protocol
   in complex environments. We investigated our sensor protocol with
   microelectrodes on custom Pt/Ir-wire tetrodes by in vivo measurements in
   the rat brain for up to four weeks. Results showed that catalytic
   activity of the electrode is lost over time, but our protocol is
   repeatedly able to both quantify and restore electrode sensitivity in
   vivo. Significance. Our approach is highly relevant because it can be
   applied to any existing Pt electrode. Current methods to assess the
   brain/electrode microenvironment mainly rely on imaging techniques,
   histology and analysis of explanted devices, which are often end-point
   methods. Our procedure delivers online and time-transient information on
   the chemical microenvironment directly at the electrode/tissue interface
   of neural implants, gives new insight into the charge transfer
   processes, and delivers information on the state of the electrode itself
   addressing long-term electrode degradation.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the development, characterization, and validation
   of neural probes serving the growing needs of neuroscience for
   miniaturized tools enabling simultaneous high-resolution recording of
   neural activity in multiple brain areas. The probes consist of a
   needle-shaped shaft with a cross-section of 100 x 50 mu m(2) and a
   length of 10 or 5 mm emerging from a base with dimensions of only
   0.55x1.8 mm(2). The shafts carry 1600 and 800 recording sites,
   respectively, grouped into 50 (respectively 25) blocks of 4 x 8
   electrodes with an area of 17 x 17 mu m(2) each, a pitch of 20 mu m, and
   an electrode-toelectrode spacing of 3 mu m. The probes are fabricated
   using a commercial 0.18 mu m CMOS process followed by dedicated
   metallization, passivation, and microfabrication steps. Neural signals
   are accessible through 32 analog output channels via a hierarchical
   digital addressing scheme implementing an advanced electronic depth
   control concept giving the option of multiple scanning modes and
   offering a switching time of 416 mu s at a clock frequency of 1 MHz. All
   output channels are shielded against each other, whereby crosstalk
   between neighboring channels is measured to be -58 dB at 1 kHz. Absolute
   impedance values at 1 kHz of single IrOx and Pt electrodes are 230 +/-
   38 k Omega and 2.2 +/- 0.3 M Omega, respectively. In vivo recordings
   taking advantage of the new addressing concept for high-resolution
   recordings from multiple brain regions were successfully performed in
   anesthetized rats.},

Abstract = {EEG-fMRI has gained increasing importance in epilepsy pre-surgical
   diagnosis. However, 40-70\% of EEG-fMRI recordings in patients lack
   interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) during the scan, which could
   be overcome by detecting matching topography maps. We tried to validate
   this method in clinical settings taking various electroclinical factors
   into consideration. Eleven patients who had undergone EEG-fMRI during
   pre-surgical evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy and who had had
   clinical long-term video-EEG were studied. Spike-related blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) maps were created using IEDs occurring during the
   EEG-fMRI scan. Separate maps were then generated from IEDs marked on the
   clinical long-term EEG recordings, which were averaged to produce
   topographical IED maps and correlated with the EEGs recorded inside the
   scanner yielding a correlation coefficient time course. Epileptogenic
   zones were defined by an expert panel during pre-surgical evaluation and
   validated by an epilepsy surgery resulting in a good outcome. Both
   techniques' performance was evaluated according to factors including
   arousal during IED recording, IED topography and lateralization, lesion
   type, and localization. Topography-related EEG-fMRI yielded more
   specific results compared to the spike-related method. Superficial
   lesion location and ipsilateral IED seem to result in a higher
   concordance of BOLD maps. The polarity of BOLD responses may be
   lesion-dependent, and both positive and negative BOLD changes may be
   associated with the irritative zone. Topography-related EEG-fMRI may
   show improved specificity especially for superficial lesions producing
   ipsilateral spikes. This method can be used as an alternative either in
   the absence of spikes during the simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition or to
   sharpen a diffusely activated BOLD-map.},

Abstract = {The local field potential (LFP) emerges from ion movements across neural
   membranes. Since the voltage recorded by LFP electrodes reflects the
   summed electrical field of a large volume of brain tissue, extracting
   information about local activity is challenging. Studying neuronal
   microcircuits, however, requires a reliable distinction between truly
   local events and volume-conducted signals originating in distant brain
   areas. Current source density (CSD) analysis offers a solution for this
   problem by providing information about current sinks and sources in the
   vicinity of the electrodes. In brain areas with laminar cytoarchitecture
   such as the hippocampus, one-dimensional CSD can be obtained by
   estimating the second spatial derivative of the LFP. Here, we describe a
   method to record multilaminar LFPs using linear silicon probes implanted
   into the dorsal hippocampus. CSD traces are computed along individual
   shanks of the probe. This protocol thus describes a procedure to resolve
   spatially restricted neuronal network oscillations in the hippocampus of
   freely moving mice.},

Abstract = {We report a method to determine the radiative efficiency (eta(rad)) of
   GaN-based light-emitting diodes using excitation density and bias
   dependent room temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements
   selectively exciting the active region. Considering carrier escape by
   tunnelling out of the active region, we extrapolate the generation rate
   of charge carriers from photocurrent measurements under reverse bias. A
   model describing the recombination of carriers including phase-space
   filling is then fitted to excitation density dependent PL data obtained
   under forward bias to extract grad. Results show that grad vs. carrier
   density is asymmetric around its maximum due to phasespace filling.

   material properties is studied. A new flip-chip reflow soldering process
   with Bi57Sn42Ag1 soldering paste is presented that allows for enhanced
   thermal coupling of the generators. The manufactured generators are
   electrically and thermally fully characterized. They generate up to 1.63

Abstract = {Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder
   with broad symptomatic manifestations. The current study examined, for
   the first time, olfactory memory and discrimination in the Flinders

   controls were trained on an Olfactory Discrimination (OD) and a Social
   Interaction (SI) test. On the OD test, the FSL and controls performed
   similarly at the shortest inter-trial interval (5 min), however, with
   extended delay of 30 min, the FSLs had a recall and odour discrimination
   deficit. At the longest delay (60 min) both groups performed poorly. The
   FSL rats i.) had a deficit in olfactory discrimination suggesting
   impairment in olfactory memory and recall; ii.) were less likely to
   socialize with unfamiliar rats. The data suggests that FSL animals have
   an impaired olfactory information processing capacity.},

Abstract = {We study the spatial intensity distribution and the self-reconstruction
   of quasi-Bessel beams produced from refractive axicon lenses with edge
   emitting laser diodes as asymmetric and astigmatic illumination sources.
   Comparing these to a symmetric mono-mode fiber source, we find that the
   asymmetry results in a transition of a quasi-Bessel beam into a bow-tie
   shaped pattern and eventually to a line shaped profile at a larger
   distance along the optical axis. Furthermore, we analytically estimate
   and discuss the effects of astigmatism, substrate modes and non-perfect
   axicons. We find a good agreement between experiment, simulation and
   analytic considerations. Results include the derivation of a maximal
   axicon angle related to astigmatism of the illuminating beam, impact of
   laser diode beam profile imperfections like substrate modes and a
   longitudinal oscillation of the core intensity and radius caused by a
   rounded axicon tip. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America},

   continuous stimulation.\& para;\& para;Results: Weight dynamics was
   assessed continuously and indicated similar growth rates although the
   FSL rats weighed approximately 20-25\% less. MFB DBS had no impact on
   ultrasound calls emitted and the FSL rats continued to vocalize
   significantly less in the positive affect frequency compared to
   controls. Similarly, stimulation did not influence the FSL's exploration
   level (Elevated Plus Maze), nor locomotion (Open Field), although it
   reduced their freezing behavior (Open Field). Importantly, MFB DBS
   improved cognitive performance (Double-H) compared to Controls by
   reducing the time required and the number of errors committed to
   complete a spatial task.\& para;\& para;Conclusion: MFB DBS in the FSL
   animals selectively affected certain types of behaviors. Exploration and
   vocalization remained unaltered, but cognitive performance such as speed
   and precision of memory recall improved compared to unstimulated and
   stimulated controls. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms of
   action of MFB DBS, and in particular on the role of dopamine in the

Title = {Deep Brain Stimulation of the Medial Forebrain Bundle in a Rodent Model

Abstract = {Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the medial forebrain bundle
   (MFB) can reverse depressive-like symptoms clinically and in
   experimental models of depression, but the mechanisms of action are
   unknown. Objectives: This study investigated the role of dopaminergic
   mechanisms in MFB stimulation-mediated behavior changes, in conjunction
   with raclopride administration and micropositron emission tomography
   (micro-PET). Methods: Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats were allocated
   into 4 groups: FSL (no treatment), FSL+ (DBS), FSL.R (FSL with
   raclopride), and FSL.R+ (FSL with raclopride and DBS). Animals were
   implanted with bilateral electrodes targeting the MFB and given 11 days
   access to raclopride in the drinking water with or without concurrent
   continuous bilateral DBS over the last 10 days. Behavioral testing was
   conducted after stimulation. A PET scan using
   {[}F-18]desmethoxyfallypride was performed to determine D2 receptor
   availability before and after raclopride treatment. Changes in gene
   expression in the nucleus accumbens and the hippocampus were assessed
   using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Micro-PET imaging
   showed that raclopride administration blocked 36\% of the D2 receptor in
   the striatum, but the relative level of blockade was reduced/modulated
   by stimulation. Raclopride treatment enhanced depressive-like symptoms
   in several tasks, and the MFB DBS partially reversed the depressive-like
   phenotype. The raclopride-treated MFB DBS animals had increased levels
   of mRNA coding for dopamine receptor D1 and D2 suggestive of a
   stimulation-mediated increase in dopamine receptors. Conclusion: Data
   suggest that chronic and continuous MFB DBS could act via the modulation
   of the midbrain dopaminergic transmission, including impacting on the
   postsynaptic dopamine receptor profile.},

Abstract = {An innovative micro thermoelectric generator (mu TEG) fabrication
   process has been developed. Two selectively dissolvable photoresists and
   galvanostatic electrodeposition are used to grow p-and n-type
   thermoelectric materials as well as the upper and lower contacts of the
   mu TEGs onto a single substrate. Two particular features of the process
   are the usage of a multilamination technique to create structures for
   legs and contacts, as well as an industrial pick and placer (P\&P),
   which allows dispensing of a second, selectively dissolvable,
   photoresist to protect certain areas during material deposition. This
   allows sequential electrochemical deposition of two different
   thermoelectric materials on a single substrate, without further costly
   and time-consuming process steps. The process therefore provides a
   highly flexible fabrication platform for research and development.},

Title = {A Wireless EEG Recording Method for Rat Use inside the Water Maze},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {With the continued miniaturisation of portable embedded systems,
   wireless EEG recording techniques are becoming increasingly prevalent in
   animal behavioural research. However, in spite of their versatility and
   portability, they have seldom been used inside water-maze tasks designed
   for rats. As such, a novel 3D printed implant and waterproof connector
   is presented, which can facilitate wireless water-maze EEG recordings in
   freely-moving rats, using a commercial wireless recording system (W32;
   Multichannel Systems). As well as waterproofing the wireless system,
   battery, and electrode connector, the implant serves to reduce
   movement-related artefacts by redistributing movement-related forces
   away from the electrode connector. This implant/connector was able to
   successfully record high-quality LFP in the hippocampo-striatal brain
   regions of rats as they undertook a procedurallearning variant of the
   double-H water-maze task. Notably, there were no significant performance
   deficits through its use when compared with a control group across a
   number of metrics including number of errors and speed of task
   completion. Taken together, this method can expand the range of
   measurements that are currently possible in this diverse area of
   behavioural neuroscience, whilst paving the way for integration with
   more complex behaviours.},

Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {127-137},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The APOE epsilon 4 allele increases the risk for sporadic Alzheimer's
   disease and modifies brain activation patterns of numerous cognitive
   domains. We assessed cognitively intact older adults with a letter
   n-back task to determine if previously observed increases in epsilon 4
   carriers' working-memory-related brain activation are compensatory such
   that they serve to maintain working memory function. Using multiple
   regression models, we identified interactions of APOE variant and age in
   bilateral hippocampus independently from task performance: epsilon 4
   carriers only showed a decrease in activation with increasing age,
   suggesting high sensitivity of fMRI data for detecting changes in
   Alzheimer's diseaseerelevant brain areas before cognitive decline.
   Moreover, we identified epsilon 4 carriers to show higher activations in
   task-negative medial and task-positive inferior frontal areas along with
   better performance under high working memory load relative to
   non-epsilon 4 carriers. The increased frontal recruitment is compatible
   with models of neuronal compensation, extends on existing evidence, and
   suggests that epsilon 4 carriers require additional neuronal resources
   to successfully perform a demanding working memory task. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Hippocampal theta oscillations are associated with cognitive functions
   and their disorder has been linked with pathological conditions, such as
   temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Brief periods of
   theta-band stimulation have been shown to promote therapeutical effects
   in neurological disease models. However, an adequate tuning of
   stimulation intensity is required for longer periods of stimulation,
   since high amplitudes or strong transients may induce pathological
   hypersynchronization and seizures. We have developed and implemented an
   adaptive control strategy to regulate the amplitude of theta-band
   oscillations induced by sinusoidal optogenetic stimulation. Experimental
   validation on freely behaving mice showed that adaptive control
   maintained a stable oscillatory amplitude in the response across changes
   in brain state and consistently reduced the mean squared error to
   reference compared to open-loop control. The proposed method may aid in
   investigating the role and therapeutical benefits of theta oscillations
   in cognition and neurological disorders.},

Title = {Targeted partial reconstruction for real-time fMRI with arbitrary
   trajectories},
Journal = {MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: A partial image reconstruction formalism is introduced for the
   targeted extraction of real-time feedback from arbitrary trajectories
   when full image reconstruction in real time is computationally too
   demanding.
   Methods: Explicit calculation and storage of linear combinations of
   lines of the reconstruction matrix by an incomplete basis change in
   spatial coordinates lead to translation of the expensive full
   reconstruction from a frame-wise application to a region of interest
   (ROI)-wise application. This step is independent from signal data and
   can be executed before the experiment. Subsequently, the results of the
   sum over fully reconstructed voxels can be evaluated directly. Data from
   a high-speed fMRI acquisition was used to investigate the targeted
   partial reconstruction of a functional ROI atlas, incorporating an
   intravolume dephasing correction. The same data and ROIs were used for a
   comparison of the time series obtained with those obtained from already
   existing methods for compartment-wise reconstruction. To examine
   real-time feasibility, the reconstruction was implemented and tested for
   online reconstruction performance.
   Results: The reconstruction yields results that are virtually identical
   to the standard reconstruction (i.e., the magnitude sums over the ROIs),
   with negligible discrepancies even after termination of the conjugate
   gradient algorithm at a feasible number of iterations. Notably, more
   discrepancies arise with existing compartment-wise reconstructions. The
   online real-time implementation evaluated 1 ROI within 2.8 ms in the
   case of a highly parallel 3D whole brain acquisition.
   Conclusion: The high reconstruction fidelity and speed are satisfying
   for the exemplary application of real-time functional feedback using a
   highly parallel 3D whole brain acquisition.},

   blocks of 32 electrodes each along a 100-mu m-wide and 10-mm-long probe
   shaft. The electrodes within each block have a vertical and horizontal
   pitch of 20 mu m resulting in an electrode-to-electrode separation of 3
   mu m. Single recording sites as well as combinations of 2x2 adjacent
   electrodes forming a virtually larger recording site of reduced
   impedance can be read out via 32 parallel analog output channels. The
   system was designed and fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS technology
   followed by an in-house post-CMOS process used to realize the electrode
   metallization and define the probe geometry. System functionality for
   electrode selection was verified by activating individual blocks along
   the shaft and switching recording sites to specific output channels.
   Impedance characterization of the electrodes revealed absolute values of
   2.2 +/- 0.3 MO and 550 +/- 50 k Omega at 1 kHz for individual Pt
   electrodes and 2x2 electrode combinations, respectively.},

Title = {Time-domain principal component reconstruction (tPCR): A more efficient
   and stable iterative reconstruction framework for non-Cartesian
   functional MRI},

Abstract = {Purpose: To improve the reconstruction efficiency (i.e., computational
   load) and stability of iterative reconstruction for non-Cartesian fMRI
   when using high undersampling rates and/or in the presence of strong
   off-resonance effects.
   Theory and Methods: The magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG)
   sequence with 3D non-Cartesian trajectory and 0.1s repetition time (TR)
   was applied to acquire fMRI datasets. Different from a conventional
   time-point-by-time-point sequential reconstruction (SR), the proposed
   time-domain principal component reconstruction (tPCR) performs three
   steps: (1) decomposing the k-t-space fMRI datasets into time-domain
   principal component space using singular value decomposition, (2)
   reconstructing each principal component with redistributed computation
   power according to their weights, and (3) combining the reconstructed
   principal components back to image-t-space. The comparison of
   reconstruction accuracy was performed by simulation experiments and then
   verified in real fMRI data.
   Results: The simulation experiments showed that the proposed tPCR was
   able to significantly reduce reconstruction errors, and subsequent
   functional activation errors, relative to SR at identical computational
   cost. Alternatively, at fixed reconstruction accuracy, computation time
   was greatly reduced. The improved performance was particularly obvious
   for L1-norm nonlinear reconstructions relative to L2-norm linear
   reconstructions and robust to different regularization strength,
   undersampling rates, and off-resonance effects intensity. By examining
   activation maps, tPCR was also found to give similar improvements in
   real fMRI experiments.
   Conclusion: The proposed proof-of-concept tPCR framework could improve
   (1) the reconstruction efficiency of iterative reconstruction, and (2)
   the reconstruction stability especially for nonlinear reconstructions.
   As a practical consideration, the improved reconstruction speed promotes
   the application of highly undersampled non-Cartesian fast fMRI.},

Title = {Adapting the concepts of brain and cognitive reserve to post-stroke
   cognitive deficits: Implications for understanding neglect},
Journal = {CORTEX},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {327-338},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Advanced lesion mapping and connectivity analyses are currently the main
   tools used to understand the mechanisms underlying post-stroke cognitive
   deficits. However, the factors contributing to pre-stroke architecture
   of cognitive networks are often ignored, even though they reportedly
   play a decisive role in the manifestation of cognitive impairment in
   neurodegeneration. The present review on post-stroke cognitive deficits
   therefore adopts the concept of brain and cognitive reserve, which was
   originally developed to account for the individual differences in the
   course of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. By focusing on spatial
   neglect, a typical network disorder, it is discussed how individual
   susceptibility to stroke lesion might explain the reported discrepancies
   in lesion anatomy, non-spatial deficits and recovery courses. A detailed
   analysis of the literature reveals that premorbid brain (age, brain
   atrophy, previous strokes, leukoaraiosis, genetic factors, etc.) and
   cognitive reserve (IQ life experience, education, occupation, premorbid
   cognitive impairment, etc.) greatly impact the brain's capacity for
   compensation. Furthermore, the interaction between pre-stroke
   brain/cognitive reserve and the degree of stroke-induced system
   impairment (e.g., hypoperfusion, lesion load) determines both the extent
   of neglect symptoms variability and the course of recovery. Premorbid
   brain/cognitive reserves should thus be considered to: (i) understand
   the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disorders and sufficiently
   explain their inter-individual variability; (ii) provide a prognosis for
   cognitive recovery and hence post-stroke dependency; (iii) identify
   individual targets for cognitive rehabilitation: in the case of reduced
   brain/cognitive reserve, neglect might occur even with a confined
   lesion, and non-spatial training of general attentional capacity should
   represent the main therapeutic target also for treatment of neglect;
   this might be true also for non-cognitive domains, e.g., motor deficit.
   This alternative view of how neglect and other cognitive deficits occur
   and recover promotes discussion about plasticity and recovery to a
   general rather than a single stroke-based domain, providing more
   efficiency in recovery research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Soft goals in planning are optional objectives that should be achieved
   in the terminal state. However, failing to achieve them does not result
   in the plan becoming invalid. State trajectory constraints are hard
   requirements towards the state trajectory of the plan. Soft trajectory
   constraints are a combination of both: soft preferences on how the hard
   goals are reached, i.e., optional requirements towards the state
   trajectory of the plan. Such a soft trajectory constraint may require
   that some fact should be always true, or should be true at some point
   during the plan. The quality of a plan is then measured by a metric
   which adds the sum of all action costs and a penalty for each failed
   soft trajectory constraint. Keyder and Geffner showed that soft goals
   can be compiled away. We generalize this approach and illustrate a
   method of compiling soft trajectory constraints into conditional effects
   and state dependent action costs using LTLf and deterministic finite
   automata. We provide two compilation schemes, with and without reward
   shaping, by rewarding and penalizing different states in the plan. With
   this we are able to handle such soft trajectory constraints without the
   need of altering the search algorithm or heuristics, using classical
   planners.},

Title = {Electrophysiological and molecular effects of bilateral deep brain
   stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle in a rodent model of
   depression},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {355},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the Medial Forebrain Bundle
   (MFB) induces antidepressant effects both clinically and pre-clinically.
   However, the acute electrophysiological changes induced by MFB DBS
   remain unknown.Objective: The study investigated acute mfb DBS effects
   on neuronal oscillations in distinct neuronal populations implicated in
   the pathophysiology of depression.Methods: The Flinders Sensitive Line
   (FSL) rodent depression model and Sprague-Dawley (SD) controls were used
   in the study. Recording electrodes were implanted unilaterally in the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral
   tegmental area (VTA); DBS electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the
   mfb. The FSL Stim and SD Stim received bilateral mfb DBS, whereas the
   FSL Sham and SD Shams were not stimulated. Local field potentials (LFPs)
   from all areas were recorded at baseline, during, and post stimulation.
   Neuronal oscillations were analyzed.Results: mfb DBS induced 1) a
   significant increase of low gamma (30-45 Hz) oscillations in the mPFC
   uniquely in FSLs; 2) a significant increase of low gamma oscillations in
   the NAc and VTA in SDs and FSLs; and 3) an increase in the expression of
   Gad1 in the mPFC of FSL and SDs, while only increasing the expression in
   the NAc of FSLs.Conclusion: mfb DBS differentially affected neuronal
   oscillations in the mPFC, NAc and VTA across SD and FSL rats. Low gamma
   oscillations rose significantly in the mPFC of FSL rats. Molecular
   analysis points to a mechanism involving GABAergic interneurons as they
   regulate low gamma oscillations.},

Abstract = {Grammar provides the framework for understanding and producing language.
   In aphasia, an acquired language disorder, grammatical deficits are
   diversified and widespread. However, the few assessments for testing
   grammar in the German language do not consider current linguistic,
   psycholinguistic, and functional imaging data, which have been shown to
   be crucial for effective treatment. This study developed German language
   versions of the Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences (NAVS-G)
   and the Northwestern Anagram Test (NAT-G) to examine comprehension and
   production of verbs, controlling for the number and optionality of verb
   arguments, and sentences with increasing syntactic complexity. The
   NAVS-G and NAT-G were tested in 27 healthy participants, 15 right
   hemispheric stroke patients without aphasia, and 15 stroke patients with
   mild to residual aphasia. Participants without aphasia showed
   near-perfect performance, with the exception of (object) relative
   sentences, where accuracy was associated with educational level. In each
   patient with aphasia, deficits in more than one subtest were observed.
   The within and between population-groups logistic mixed regression
   analyses identified significant impairments in processing syntactic
   complexity at the verb and sentence levels. These findings indicate that
   the NAVS-G and NAT-G have potential for testing grammatical competence
   in (German) stroke patients.},

Abstract = {An analog data compression scheme for massively-parallel observation of
   neural activity is presented, that simultaneously reduces the total
   number of physical transmission lines. The compression is realized by
   superimposing signals of different recording sites on one common
   transmission line, a reconstruction of spatial information is achievable
   by correlation, for which three simple mathematical operations are
   presented. The generalized system-theoretical description allows to
   apply the concept to any multidimensional analog sensing network, and
   grants to extract the relation between compression and SNR reduction.
   Simulation-based examples of neural recording arrays revealed possible
   transmission line reductions of 92\% in a 25x25 array with 11.5 dB
   higher noise floor, or 70.8\% in a 6x8 array with an SNR reduction
   equivalent to only 1 bit of resolution.},

Abstract = {Strong permanent adhesion between thin-film polyimide (BPDA-PPD) and
   silicone rubber (MED-1000) was achieved through deposition of a
   chemically-transitive intermediate adhesion promoting layer.
   Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of SiC and SiO2 was
   used to grow a thin 50 nm layer directly on a 5 mu m thin polyimide
   substrate. The deposition at low pressures permitted the fabrication of
   an adaptive covalent bond transition from sp2-hybridized carbon (in
   polyimide) towards the sp3 bonding in SiC, continuing to SiO2 which
   provides a good bonding partner for one-component poly-dimethyl siloxane
   (PDMS). The fabricated laminates together with reference probes
   containing no adhesion promoting layer were subjected to intense
   accelerated aging at 125 degrees C and 130 kPa (pressure cooker) over 96
   hrs in phosphate buffered saline solution. While the reference
   polyimide-PDMS laminates failed just after 30 min in the pressure
   cooker, no failure was detected on samples using the proposed adhesion
   promoter technique. Mechanical loading of the samples resulted in
   cohesive crack formation at the polyimide, propagating across the bulk
   with no evidence of adhesive failure between any of the materials. The
   strong permanent adhesion brings the fabrication of hybrid neural
   interfaces one step forward, achieving the combination of thin-film
   manufacturing and PDMS.},

Title = {Trading off spatio-temporal properties in 3D high-speed fMRI using

Abstract = {Purpose: Highly undersampled acquisitions have been proposed to push the
   limits of temporal resolution in functional MRI. This contribution is
   aimed at identifying parameter sets that let the user trade-off between
   ultra-high temporal resolution and spatial signal quality by varying the
   sampling densities. The proposed method maintains the synergies of a
   temporal resolution that enables direct filtering of physiological
   artifacts for highest statistical power, and 3D read-outs with optimal
   use of encoding capabilities of multi-coil arrays for efficient sampling
   and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
   Methods: One-to four-shot interleaved spherical stack-of-spiral
   trajectories with repetition times from 96 to 352 ms at a nominal
   resolution of 3 mm using different sampling densities were compared for
   image quality and temporal SNR (tSNR). The one-and three-shot
   trajectories were employed in a resting state study for functional
   characterization.
   Results: Compared to a previously described single-shot trajectory,
   denser sampled trajectories of the same type are shown to be less prone
   to blurring and off-resonance vulnerability that appear in addition to
   the variable density artifacts of the point spread function. While the
   multi-shot trajectories lead to a decrease in tSNR efficiency, the high
   SNR due to the 3D read-out, combined with notable increases in image
   quality, leads to superior overall results of the three-shot interleaved
   stack of spirals. A resting state analysis of 15 subjects shows
   significantly improved functional sensitivity in areas of high
   off-resonance gradients.
   Conclusion: Mild variable-density sampling leads to excellent tSNR
   behavior and no increased off-resonance vulnerability, and is suggested
   unless maximum temporal resolution is sought.},

Title = {Reliability of spring interconnects for high channel-count polyimide
   electrode arrays},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Active neural implants with a high channel-count need robust and
   reliable operational assembly for the targeted environment in order to
   be classified as viable fully implantable systems. The discrete
   functionality of the electrode array and the implant electronics is
   vital for intact assembly. A critical interface exists at the
   interconnection sites between the electrode array and the implant
   electronics, especially in hybrid assemblies (e.g. retinal implants)
   where electrodes and electronics are not on the same substrate. Since
   the interconnects in such assemblies cannot be hermetically sealed,
   reliable protection against the physiological enviromnent is essential
   for delivering high insulation resistance and low defusibility of salt
   ions, which are limited in complexity by current assembly techniques.
   This work reports on a combination of spring-type interconnects on a
   polyimide array with silicone rubber gasket insulation for chronically
   active implantable systems. The spring design of the interconnects on
   the backend of the electrode array compensates for the uniform thickness
   of the sandwiched gasket during bonding in assembly and relieves the
   propagation of extrinsic stresses to the bulk polyimide substrate. The
   contact resistance of the microflex-bonded spring interconnects with the
   underlying metallized ceramic test vehicles and insulation through the
   gasket between adjacent contacts was investigated against the MIL883
   standard. The contact and insulation resistances remained stable in the
   exhausting environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {As service robots become more and more capable of performing useful
   tasks for us, there is a growing need to teach robots how we expect them
   to carry out these tasks. However, different users typically have their
   own preferences, for example with respect to arranging objects on
   different shelves. As many of these preferences depend on a variety of
   factors including personal taste, cultural background, or common sense,
   it is challenging for an expert to pre-program a robot in order to
   accommodate all potential users. At the same time, it is impractical for
   robots to constantly query users about how they should perform
   individual tasks. In this work, we present an approach to learn patterns
   in user preferences for the task of tidying up objects in containers,
   e.g. shelves or boxes. Our method builds upon the paradigm of
   collaborative filtering for making personalized recommendations and
   relies on data from different users which we gather using crowdsourcing.
   To deal with novel objects for which we have no data, we propose a
   method that compliments standard collaborative filtering by leveraging
   information mined from the Web. When solving a tidy-up task, we first
   predict pairwise object preferences of the user. Then, we subdivide the
   objects in containers by modeling a spectral clustering problem. Our
   solution is easy to update, does not require complex modeling, and
   improves with the amount of user data. We evaluate our approach using
   crowdsourcing data from over 1200 users and demonstrate its
   effectiveness for two tidy-up scenarios. Additionally, we show that a
   real robot can reliably predict user preferences using our approach.},

Abstract = {The successful translation of novel implantable technologies to clinical
   applications demands the comprehensive preclinical evaluation of the
   devices in vivo. This work aims to facilitate such translation by
   proposing a miniaturized multimodal thin-film deep brain stimulation (mu
   DBS) device, tailored to rodent anatomy. The device was realized by
   incorporating glassy carbon (GC) electrodes into a thin-film
   polyimide-based substrate. The finished probe featured nine GC active
   sites with diameters ranging from 50 mu m to 300 mu m. The performed
   fast scan cyclic voltammetry revealed a dopamine sensitivity of 12.63
   +/- 2.19 nA mu M-1, 20.72 +/- 4.33 nA mu M-1, 135.44 +/- 8.24 nA mu M-1,
   and 68.50 +/- 3.42 mu M-1 for electrodes with diameter of 50 mu m, 100
   mu m, 200 mu m, and 300 mu m, respectively. The in vitro
   characterization assessed the mu DBS probe's ability to address
   electrical stimulation - in addition to neurochemical sensing - in a
   single integrated device. Future evaluation of the mu-DBS probes as a
   multimodal platform in animal models remains to be the next step in this
   path.},

Abstract = {We train generative ``up-convolutional' neural networks which are able
   to generate images of objects given object style, viewpoint, and color.
   We train the networks on rendered 3D models of chairs, tables, and cars.
   Our experiments show that the networks do not merely learn all images by
   heart, but rather find a meaningful representation of 3D models allowing
   them to assess the similarity of different models, interpolate between
   given views to generate the missing ones, extrapolate views, and invent
   new objects not present in the training set by recombining training
   instances, or even two different object classes. Moreover, we show that
   such generative networks can be used to find correspondences between
   different objects from the dataset, outperforming existing approaches on
   this task.},

   and directly butt-coupled to micromachined hybrid-polymer waveguides
   (WGs) enables highly compact systems for optogenetics. Co-integrated
   microelectrodes are aligned to the optical stimulation sites in
   application specific electrode arrangements. Temperature sensing
   elements embedded below the LD pads and at other selected locations
   along the probe shafts enable the temperature to be monitored during
   system operation. A large variety of probes has been realized.},

Abstract = {Shakey the robot was one of the first autonomous robots that showed
   impressive capabilities of navigation and mobile manipulation. Since
   then, robotics research has made great progress, showing more and more
   capable robotic systems for a large variety of application domains and
   tasks. In this letter, we look back on decades of research by rebuilding
   Shakey with modern robotics technology in the open-source Shakey 2016
   system. Hereby, we demonstrate the impact of research by showing that
   ideas from the original Shakey are still alive in state-of-the-art
   systems, while robotics in general has improved to deliver more robust
   and more capable software and hardware. Our Shakey 2016 system has been
   implemented on real robots and leverages mostly open-source software. We
   experimentally evaluate the system in real-world scenarios on a PR2
   robot and a Turtlebot-based robot and particularly investigate the
   development effort. The experiments documented in this letter
   demonstrate that results from robotics research are readily available
   for building complex robots such as Shakey within a short amount of time
   and little effort.},

Title = {Ethical and Legal Implications of the Methodological Crisis in

Volume = {26},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Currently, many scientific fields such as psychology or biomedicine face
   a methodological crisis concerning the reproducibility, replicability,
   and validity of their research. In neuroimaging, similar methodological
   concerns have taken hold of the field, and researchers are working
   frantically toward finding solutions for the methodological problems
   specific to neuroimaging. This article examines some ethical and legal
   implications of this methodological crisis in neuroimaging. With respect
   to ethical challenges, the article discusses the impact of flawed
   methods in neuroimaging research in cognitive and clinical neuroscience,
   particularly with respect to faulty brain-based models of human
   cognition, behavior, and personality. Specifically examined is whether
   such faulty models, when they are applied to neurological or psychiatric
   diseases, could put patients at risk, and whether this places special
   obligations on researchers using neuroimaging. In the legal domain, the
   actual use of neuroimaging as evidence in United States courtrooms is
   surveyed, followed by an examination of ways that the methodological
   problems may create challenges for the criminal justice system. Finally,
   the article reviews and promotes some promising ideas and initiatives
   from within the neuroimaging community for addressing the methodological
   problems.},

Title = {Planning performance in schizophrenia patients: a meta-analysis of the
   influence of task difficulty and clinical and sociodemographic variables},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {47},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2002-2016},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background Despite a large body of research on planning performance in
   adult schizophrenia patients, results of individual studies are
   equivocal, suggesting either no, moderate or severe planning deficits.
   This meta-analysis therefore aimed to quantify planning deficits in
   schizophrenia and to examine potential sources of the heterogeneity seen
   in the literature.
   Method The meta-analysis comprised outcomes of planning accuracy of 1377
   schizophrenia patients and 1477 healthy controls from 31 different
   studies which assessed planning performance using tower tasks such as
   the Tower of London, the Tower of Hanoi and the Stockings of Cambridge.
   A meta-regression analysis was applied to assess the influence of
   potential moderator variables (i.e. sociodemographic and clinical
   variables as well as task difficulty).
   Results The findings indeed demonstrated a planning deficit in
   schizophrenia patients (mean effect size: ; 95\% confidence interval
   0.56-0.78) that was moderated by task difficulty in terms of the minimum
   number of moves required for a solution. The results did not reveal any
   significant relationship between the extent of planning deficits and
   sociodemographic or clinical variables.
   Conclusions The current results provide first meta-analytic evidence for
   the commonly assumed impairments of planning performance in
   schizophrenia. Deficits are more likely to become manifest in problem
   items with higher demands on planning ahead, which may at least partly
   explain the heterogeneity of previous findings. As only a small fraction
   of studies reported coherent information on sample characteristics,
   future meta-analyses would benefit from more systematic reports on those
   variables.},

Abstract = {In this study, the release of fluorescein from a photo-crosslinked
   conducting polymer hydrogel made from a hydrogel precursor
   poly(dimethylacrylamide-co-4-methacryloyloxy benzophenone
   (5\%)-co-4-styrenesulfonate (2.5\%)) (PDMAAp) and the conducting polymer
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is investigated. Fluorescein,
   here used as a model for a drug, is actively released through
   application of an electrical trigger signal. The detected quantity is
   more than six times higher in comparison to that released from a
   conventional PEDOT/polysterene sulfonate (PSS) system. Release profiles,
   drug dose, and timing can be tailored by the application of different
   trigger signals and pretreatments. To demonstrate that the novel drug
   release system can be used for a drug relevant for local delivery to a
   neural interface, experiments are furthermore performed with the
   anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (Dex). The conducting polymer
   hydrogel facilitates the active release of Dex, in comparison to the
   previously used PEDOT/Dex. It is suggested that PEDOT/PDMAAp is an
   interesting alternative for conducting polymer based drug release
   systems, with the potential to offer more volume for storage, yet
   retaining the excellent electrochemical properties known for PEDOT
   electrodes.},

Title = {The Double-H Maze: A Robust Behavioral Test for Learning and Memory in
   Rodents},
Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},
Year = {2015},
Number = {101},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Spatial cognition research in rodents typically employs the use of maze
   tasks, whose attributes vary from one maze to the next. These tasks vary
   by their behavioral flexibility and required memory duration, the number
   of goals and pathways, and also the overall task complexity. A
   confounding feature in many of these tasks is the lack of control over
   the strategy employed by the rodents to reach the goal, e.g.,
   allocentric (declarative-like) or egocentric (procedural) based
   strategies. The double-H maze is a novel water-escape memory task that
   addresses this issue, by allowing the experimenter to direct the type of
   strategy learned during the training period. The double-H maze is a
   transparent device, which consists of a central alleyway with three arms
   protruding on both sides, along with an escape platform submerged at the
   extremity of one of these arms.
   Rats can be trained using an allocentric strategy by alternating the
   start position in the maze in an unpredictable manner (see protocol 1;
   4.7), thus requiring them to learn the location of the platform based on
   the available allothetic cues. Alternatively, an egocentric learning
   strategy (protocol 2; 4.8) can be employed by releasing the rats from
   the same position during each trial, until they learn the procedural
   pattern required to reach the goal. This task has been proven to allow
   for the formation of stable memory traces.
   Memory can be probed following the training period in a misleading probe
   trial, in which the starting position for the rats alternates. Following
   an egocentric learning paradigm, rats typically resort to an
   allocentric-based strategy, but only when their initial view on the
   extra-maze cues differs markedly from their original position. This task
   is ideally suited to explore the effects of drugs/perturbations on
   allocentric/egocentric memory performance, as well as the interactions
   between these two memory systems.},

Abstract = {This work presents the design and testing of an integrated 8-channel
   CMOS biopotential recording chip, consisting of low-noise input stages,
   tunable second stage, a multiplexer, and two analog-to-digital

   input-referred noise of the first stage is selectable from 1.5 down to
   0.63 mu V-RMS (I-SS = 200 mu A), which is superior to standard
   laboratory recording systems. The device features variable lower and
   upper corner frequencies, and outputs two digital 16-bit data streams at
   62.5 kS/s. The chip die was fabricated in X-Fab 0.35 mu m CMOS
   technology and has an area of 10 mm(2).},

Title = {Temporal and spatial characteristics of high frequency oscillations as a

Abstract = {ObjectiveInterictal high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising
   candidate as a biomarker in epilepsy as well as for defining the
   seizure-onset zone as for the prediction of the surgical outcome after
   epilepsy surgery. The purpose of the study is to investigate properties
   of HFOs in long-term recordings with respect to the sleep-wake cycle and
   anatomic regions to verify previous results based on observations from
   short intervals and patients mainly with temporal lobe epilepsy to the
   analysis of hours of recordings and focal epilepsies with extratemporal
   origin.
   MethodsAutomatic HFO detection using a radial basis function neural
   network detector was performed in long-term recordings of 15 presurgical
   patients investigated with subdural strip, grid, and depth contacts.
   Periods with visual marked sleep stages based on parallel scalp
   recordings from two consecutive nights were compared to awake intervals.
   Statistical analysis was based on the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney
   U-test and Spearman's rank correlations.
   ResultsHFO rates in seizure-onset contacts differed from other brain
   regions independent of the sleep-wake cycle. For temporal contacts, the
   HFO rate increased significantly with sleep stage. In addition, contacts
   covering the parietal lobe, including rolandic cortex, showed a
   significant increase of HFO rates during sleep. However, no significant
   HFO rate changes depending on the sleep-wake cycle were found for
   frontal contacts.
   SignificanceThe rate of interictal HFOs predicted the SOZ with
   statistical significance at the group level, but properties other than
   the HFO rate may need to be considered to improve the diagnostic utility
   of HFOs. This study gives evidence that the modulation of HFO rates by
   states of the sleep-wake cycle has particular characteristics within
   different neocortical regions and in mesiotemporal structures, and
   contributes to the establishment of HFOs as a biomarker in epilepsy.},

Abstract = {Neural probes provide many options for neuroscientific research and
   medical purposes. However, these implantable micro devices are not
   functionally stable over time due to host-probe interactions. Thus,
   reliable high-resolution characterization methods are required to
   understand local tissue changes upon implantation. In this work,
   synchrotron X-ray tomography is employed for the first time to image the
   interface between brain tissue and an implanted neural probe, showing
   that this 3D imaging method is capable of resolving probe and
   surrounding tissue at a resolution of about 1 micrometer. Unstained
   tissue provides sufficient contrast to identify electrode sites on the
   probe, cells, and blood vessels within tomograms. Exemplarily, we show
   that it is possible to quantify characteristics of the interaction
   region between probe and tissue, like the blood supply system. Our
   first-time study demonstrates a way for simultaneous 3D investigation of
   brain tissue with implanted probe, providing information beyond what was
   hitherto possible.},

Title = {From speech to thought: the neuronal basis of cognitive units in
   non-experimental, real-life communication investigated using ECoG},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {Exchange of thoughts by means of expressive speech is fundamental to
   human communication. However, the neuronal basis of real-life
   communication in general, and of verbal exchange of ideas in particular,
   has rarely been studied until now. Here, our aim was to establish an
   approach for exploring the neuronal processes related to cognitive
   ``idea{''} units (IUs) in conditions of non-experimental speech
   production. We investigated whether such units corresponding to single,
   coherent chunks of speech with syntactically-defined borders, are useful
   to unravel the neuronal mechanisms underlying real-world human
   cognition. To this aim, we employed simultaneous electrocorticography
   (ECoG) and video recordings obtained in pre-neurosurgical diagnostics of
   epilepsy patients. We transcribed non-experimental, daily hospital
   conversations, identified IUs in transcriptions of the patients' speech,
   classified the obtained IUs according to a previously-proposed taxonomy
   focusing on memory content, and investigated the underlying neuronal
   activity. In each of our three subjects, we were able to collect a large
   number of IUs which could be assigned to different functional IU
   subclasses with a high inter-rater agreement. Robust IU-onset-related
   changes in spectral magnitude could be observed in high gamma
   frequencies (70-150 Hz) on the inferior lateral convexity and in the
   superior temporal cortex regardless of the IU content. A comparison of
   the topography of these responses with mouth motor and speech areas
   identified by electrocortical stimulation showed that IUs might be of
   use for extraoperative mapping of eloquent cortex (average sensitivity:
   44.4\%, average specificity: 91.1\%). High gamma responses specific to
   memory-related IU subclasses were observed in the inferior parietal and
   prefrontal regions. IU-based analysis of ECoG recordings during
   non-experimental communication thus elicits topographically- and
   functionally-specific effects. We conclude that segmentation of
   spontaneous real-world speech in linguistically-motivated units is a
   promising strategy for elucidating the neuronal basis of mental
   processing during non-experimental communication.},

Title = {Inhomogeneities in Network Structure and Excitability Govern Initiation
   and Propagation of Spontaneous Burst Activity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {The mesoscale architecture of neuronal networks strongly influences the
   initiation of spontaneous activity and its pathways of propagation.
   Spontaneous activity has been studied extensively in networks of
   cultured cortical neurons that generate complex yet reproducible
   patterns of synchronous bursting events that resemble the activity
   dynamics in developing neuronal networks in vivo. Synchronous bursts are
   mostly thought to be triggered at burst initiation sites due to build-up
   of noise or by highly active neurons, or to reflect reverberating
   activity that circulates within larger networks, although neither of
   these has been observed directly. Inferring such collective dynamics in
   neuronal populations from electrophysiological recordings crucially
   depends on the spatial resolution and sampling ratio relative to the
   size of the networks assessed. Using large-scale microelectrode arrays
   with 1024 electrodes at 0.3 mm pitch that covered the full extent of in
   vitro networks on about 1 cm(2), we investigated where bursts of
   spontaneous activity arise and how their propagation patterns relate to
   the regions of origin, the network's structure, and to the overall
   distribution of activity. A set of alternating burst initiation zones
   (BIZ) dominated the initiation of distinct bursting events and triggered
   specific propagation patterns. Moreover, BIZs were typically located in
   areas with moderate activity levels, i.e., at transitions between hot
   and cold spots. The activity-dependent alternation between these zones
   suggests that the local networks forming the dominating BIZ enter a
   transient depressed state after several cycles (similar to Eytan et al.,
   2003), allowing other BIZs to take over temporarily. We propose that
   inhomogeneities in the network structure define such BIZs and that the
   depletion of local synaptic resources limit repetitive burst initiation.},

Abstract = {Current methods for training convolutional neural networks depend on
   large amounts of labeled samples for supervised training. In this paper
   we present an approach for training a convolutional neural network using
   only unlabeled data. We train the network to discriminate between a set
   of surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a
   variety of transformations to a randomly sampled `seed' image patch. We
   find that this simple feature learning algorithm is surprisingly
   successful when applied to visual object recognition. The feature
   representation learned by our algorithm achieves classification results
   matching or outperforming the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised
   learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101).},

Title = {Analyses of Rule Breaks and Errors During Planning in Computerized Tower
   Tasks: Insights From Neurological Patients},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},
Pages = {738-753},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective: Planning as a prototypical executive function is frequently
   compromised in clinical samples. Analyses of rule breaking during
   performance on tower tasks are highly informative for clinical
   inferences on planning deficits, but are as yet only available for
   manual task versions. Therefore, the present study investigated whether
   valid rule-break information can also be gained using a computerized
   Tower of London (TOL) version.
   Method: For patients with stroke (N = 60), Parkinson's disease (PD; N =
   51), and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; N = 29), rule breaks (e.g.,
   selecting a blocked ball) and online-planning errors (re-considering the
   next move) on the TOL-Freiburg (TOL-F) were compared to that of matched
   healthy controls, and diagnostic accuracy for these measures was
   assessed.
   Results: Stroke and PD patients committed significantly more rule breaks
   and online-planning errors than matched controls, with this group
   difference being significantly greater for rule breaks. For MCI
   patients, only a trend for elevated numbers of rule breaks emerged. In
   all patients, rule breaks and errors increased as a function of problem
   complexity. Diagnostic accuracy was the highest for PD and lowest for
   MCI patients, with both rule breaks and errors demonstrating moderate
   sensitivity but higher specificity across all samples.
   Discussion: Direct attempts to break the TOL-F's task rules are
   particularly informative of clinical impairments in planning ability.
   Similar to findings from studies employing manual versions, using a
   computerized tower task revealed consistent rule break and error
   patterns across patients. Thus, computerized tower tasks can yield
   useful clinical information on rule-breaking behavior during planning in
   clinical populations.},

Abstract = {Modulating neuronal activity by electrical stimulation has expanded from
   the realm of motor indications. into the field of psychiatric disorders
   in the past 10 years. The medial forebrain bundle (MFB), with a seminal
   role in motor, reward orientated and affect regulation behaviors, and
   its afferent and efferent loci, have been targeted in several DBS trials
   in patients with psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about
   the consequences of modulating the MFB in affective disorders. The paper
   reviews the relevant preclinical literature investigating electrical
   stimulation of regions associated with the MFB in the context of several
   models of psychiatric disorders, in particular depression. The clinical
   data is promising but limited, and pre-clinical studies are essential
   for improved understanding of the anatomy, the connectivity, and the
   consequences of stimulation of the MFB and regions associated with the
   neurocircuitry of psychiatric disorders. Current data suggests that the
   MFB is at a ``privileged{''} position on this circuitry and its
   stimulation can simultaneously modulate activity at other key sites,
   such as the nucleus accumbens, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or the
   ventral tegmental area. Future experimental work will need to shed light
   on the anti-depressive mechanisms of MFB stimulation in order to
   optimize clinical interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {When planning for tasks that feature both state-dependent action costs
   and conditional effects using relaxation heuristics, the following
   problem appears: handling costs and effects separately leads to
   worse-than-necessary heuristic values, since we may get the more useful
   effect at the lower cost by choosing different values of a relaxed
   variable when determining relaxed costs and relaxed active effects. In
   this paper, we show how this issue can be avoided by representing
   state-dependent costs and conditional effects uniformly, both as
   edge-valued multi-valued decision diagrams (EVMDDs) over different sets
   of edge values, and then working with their product diagram. We develop
   a theory of EVMDDs that is general enough to encompass state-dependent
   action costs, conditional effects, and even their combination. We define
   relaxed effect semantics in the presence of state-dependent action costs
   and conditional effects, and describe how this semantics can be
   efficiently computed using product EVMDDs. This will form the foundation
   for informative relaxation heuristics in the setting with
   state-dependent costs and conditional effects combined.},

Title = {Assessment of planning performance in clinical samples: Reliability,and
   validity of the Tower of London task (TOL-F)},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {646-655},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objective: Executive deficits are frequent sequelae of neurological and
   psychiatric disorders, but their adequate neuropsychological assessment
   is still a matter of contention, given that executive tasks draw on a
   multitude of cognitive processes that are often not sufficiently
   specified. In line with this, results on psychometric properties of the
   Tower of London, a task measuring planning ability as a prototypical
   executive function, are equivocal and furthermore lacking completely for
   adult clinical populations.
   Methods: We used a structurally balanced item set implemented in the
   Tower of London (Freiburg version, TOL-F) that accounts for major
   determinants of problem difficulty beyond the commonly used minimum
   number of moves to solution. Split-half reliability, internal
   consistency, and criterion-related concurrent validity of TOL-F accuracy
   were assessed in patients with stroke (N=60), Parkinson syndrome (N=51),
   and mild cognitive impairment (N=29), and healthy adults (N=155).
   Results: Across samples, mean split-half and lower-bound indices of
   reliability of accuracy scores were adequate (r >=.7) or higher.
   Compared to a subset of healthy controls matched for age, sex, and
   education levels, deficits in planning accuracy emerged for all three
   clinical samples.
   Conclusions: Based on consistently adequate reliability and a good
   criterion-related validity of accuracy scores, the TOL-F demonstrates
   its utility for testing planning ability in clinical samples and healthy
   adults. Using item sets systematically accounting for several
   determinants of task difficulty can thus significantly enhance the
   contended reliability of executive tasks and provide an opportunity to
   resolve the underspecification of cognitive processes contributing to
   executive functioning in health and disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The perception of one's own heartbeat is a fundamental interoceptive
   process that involves cortical and subcortical structures. Yet, the
   precise spatiotemporal neuronal activity patterns underlying the
   cortical information processing have remained largely elusive. Although
   the high temporal and spatial resolution of electrocorticographic (ECoG)
   recordings is increasingly being exploited in functional neuroimaging,
   it has not been used to study heart cycle-related effects. Here, we
   addressed the capacity of ECoG to characterize neuronal signals within
   the cardiac cycle, as well as to disentangle them from heart
   cycle-related artifacts. Based on topographical distribution and
   latency, we identified a biphasic potential within the primary
   somatosensory cortex, which likely constitutes a heartbeat-evoked
   potential (HEP) of neuronal origin. We also found two different types of
   artifacts: i) oscillatory potential changes with a frequency identical
   to the heart pulse rate, which probably represent pulsatility artifacts
   and ii) sharp potentials synchronized to the R-peak, corresponding to
   the onset of ventricular contraction and the cardiac field artifact
   (CFA) in EEG. Finally, we show that heart cycle-related effects induce
   pronounced phase-synchrony patterns in the ECoG and that this kind of
   correlation patterns, which may confound ECoG connectivity studies, can
   be reduced by a suitable correction algorithm. The present study is, to
   our knowledge, the first one to show a focally localized cortical HEP
   that could be clearly and consistently observed over subjects,
   suggesting a basic role of primary sensory cortex in processing of
   heart-related sensory inputs. We also conclude that taking into account
   and reducing heart cycle-related effects may be advantageous for many
   ECoG studies, and are of crucial importance, particularly for ECoG-based
   connectivity studies. Thus, in summary, although ECoG poses new
   challenges, it opens up new possibilities for the investigation of
   heartbeat-related viscerosensory processing in the human brain. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Highly immersive virtual reality (VR) systems have been introduced into
   the consumer market in recent years. The improved technological
   capabilities of these systems as well as the combination with biometric
   sensors, for example electroencephalography (EEG), in a closed-loop
   hybrid VR-EEG, opens up a range of new potential medical applications.
   This article first provides an overview of the past and current clinical
   applications of VR systems in neurology and psychiatry and introduces
   core concepts in neurophilosophy and VR research (such as agency, trust,
   presence, and others). Then, important adverse effects of highly
   immersive VR simulations and the ethical implications of standalone and
   hybrid VR systems for therapy in neurology and psychiatry are
   highlighted. These new forms of VR-based therapy may strengthen patients
   in exercising their autonomy. At the same time, however, these emerging
   systems present ethical challenges, for example in terms of moral and
   legal accountability in interactions involving ``intelligent{''} hybrid
   VR systems. A user-centered approach that is informed by the target
   patients' needs and capabilities could help to build beneficial systems
   for VR therapy.},

Abstract = {Objective. For patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who are
   suffering from severe communication or motor problems, brain-computer
   interfaces (BCIs) can improve the quality of life and patient autonomy.
   However, current BCI systems are not as widely used as their potential
   and patient demand would let assume. This underutilization is a result
   of technological as well as user-based limitations but also of the
   comparatively poor performance of currently existing BCIs in patients
   with late-stage ALS, particularly in the locked-in state. Approach. Here
   we review a broad range of electrophysiological studies in ALS patients
   with the aim to identify electrophysiological correlates of ALS-related
   neurodegeneration in motor and non-motor brain regions in to better
   understand potential neurophysiological limitations of current BCI
   systems for ALS patients. To this end we analyze studies in ALS patients
   that investigated basic sensory evoked potentials, resting-state and
   task-based paradigms using electroencephalography or
   electrocorticography for basic research purposes as well as for
   brain-computer interfacing. Main results and significance. Our review
   underscores that, similarly to mounting evidence from neuroimaging and
   neuropathology, electrophysiological measures too indicate
   neurodegeneration in non-motor areas in ALS. Furthermore, we identify an
   unexpected gap of basic and advanced electrophysiological studies in
   late-stage ALS patients, particularly in the locked-in state. We propose
   a research strategy on how to fill this gap in order to improve the
   design and performance of future BCI systems for this patient group.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the suitability of 1-3 composite
   transducers as receivers in acoustic power transfer applications. In
   contrast to the commonly used PZT transducers, the composites allow us
   to modify the acoustic impedance, the losses and the electromechanical
   coupling factor, and hence analyse their influence on the efficiency of
   acoustic power receivers. Comparing composite receivers with 40\%, 60\%
   and 80\% filling factors, we find that the lowest filling fraction gives
   the highest efficiency. This is due to its lower acoustic mismatch with
   water, which compensates its lower electromechanical coupling and
   mechanical quality factor.},

   conditions},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {230},

Abstract = {Blinks and saccades, both ubiquitous in natural viewing conditions,
   cause rapid changes of visual inputs that are hardly consciously
   perceived. The neural dynamics in early visual areas of the human brain
   underlying this remarkable visual stability are still incompletely
   understood. We used electrocorticography (ECoG) from electrodes directly
   implanted on the human early visual areas V1, V2, V3d/v, V4d/v and the
   fusiform gyrus to investigate blink- and saccade-related neuronal
   suppression effects during non-experimental, free viewing conditions. We
   found a characteristic, biphasic, broadband gamma power
   decrease-increase pattern in all investigated visual areas. During
   saccades, a decrease in gamma power clearly preceded eye movement onset,
   at least in V1. This may indicate that cortical information processing
   is actively suppressed in human early visual areas before and during
   saccades, which then possibly mediates perceptual visual suppression.
   The following eye movement offset-related increase in gamma power may
   indicate the recovery of visual perception and the resumption of visual
   processing.},

Title = {Versatile 3D-printed headstage implant for group housing of rodents},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {257},
Pages = {134-138},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Background: An unfavourable yet necessary side-effect of stereotaxic
   surgery involves the social isolation of post-surgery rats, in order to
   protect their wound site or skull-mounted implant from damage. Social
   isolation can cause a myriad of behavioural and physiological changes
   that are detrimental to the wellbeing of rats, with potential negative
   implications for a range of experimental paradigms.
   New method. Female Sprague Dawley rats (n = 40) were implanted onto the
   skull with a novel 3D-printed headstage socket that surrounded an
   electrode connector. The socket accommodated a removable stainless-steel
   headcap for the purposes of protecting the implant. Rats were
   pair-housed following surgery, and their behaviour was monitored for up
   to several weeks under two experimental conditions that involved EEG
   recording and deep-brain stimulation, as well as behavioural test
   sessions inside an open-field maze. Rat weights were compared between
   individually- and pair-housed rats at up to 3 weeks post-surgery.
   Results: These experiments were successfully carried out using
   pair-housed rats, with no damage or complications observed regarding the
   implant and its headcap. Rats were able to carry out a range of normal
   behaviours including running, grooming, foraging and sleeping. Compared
   to individually-housed rats, pair-housed rats gained less weight over
   the 3 weeks post-implantation period.
   Comparison with existing method(s). This method offers additional
   protection compared to group-housed post-surgical rats that lack the
   protective headcap. It is also potentially more practical and versatile
   than a fully-implantable device for the safe post-surgery group housing
   of rodents.
   Conclusions: This implant design can reduce the cost of rodent upkeep,
   whilst potentially avoiding a myriad of behavioural and physiological
   changes that are known to result from social isolation. (C) 2015

Title = {Invasive brain-machine interfaces: a survey of paralyzed patients'
   attitudes, knowledge and methods of information retrieval},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objective. Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) are an emerging therapeutic
   option that can allow paralyzed patients to gain control over assistive
   technology devices (ATDs). BMI approaches can be broadly classified into
   invasive (based on intracranially implanted electrodes) and noninvasive
   (based on skin electrodes or extracorporeal sensors). Invasive BMIs have
   a favorable signal-to-noise ratio, and thus allow for the extraction of
   more information than noninvasive BMIs, but they are also associated
   with the risks related to neurosurgical device implantation. Current
   noninvasive BMI approaches are typically concerned, among other issues,
   with long setup times and/or intensive training. Recent studies have
   investigated the attitudes of paralyzed patients eligible for BMIs,
   particularly patients affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
   These studies indicate that paralyzed patients are indeed interested in
   BMIs. Little is known, however, about the degree of knowledge among
   paralyzed patients concerning BMI approaches or about how patients
   retrieve information on ATDs. Furthermore, it is not yet clear if
   paralyzed patients would accept intracranial implantation of BMI
   electrodes with the premise of decoding improvements, and what the
   attitudes of a broader range of patients with diseases such as stroke or
   spinal cord injury are towards this new kind of treatment. Approach.
   Using a questionnaire, we surveyed 131 paralyzed patients for their
   opinions on invasive BMIs and their attitude toward invasive BMI
   treatment options. Main results. The majority of the patients knew about
   and had a positive attitude toward invasive BMI approaches. The group of
   ALS patients was especially open to the concept of BMIs. The acceptance
   of invasive BMI technology depended on the improvements expected from
   the technology. Furthermore, the survey revealed that for paralyzed
   patients, the Internet is an important source of information on ATDs.
   Significance. Websites tailored to prospective BMI users should be
   further developed to provide reliable information to patients, and also
   to help to link prospective BMI users with researchers involved in the
   development of BMI technology.},

Title = {Machine-learning-based diagnostics of EEG pathology},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {220},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) methods have the potential to automate clinical
   EEG analysis. They can be categorized into feature-based (with
   handcrafted features), and end-to-end approaches (with learned
   features). Previous studies on EEG pathology decoding have typically
   analyzed a limited number of features, decoders, or both. For a I) more
   elaborate feature-based EEG analysis, and II) in-depth comparisons of
   both approaches, here we first develop a comprehensive feature-based
   framework, and then compare this framework to state-of-the-art
   end-to-end methods. To this aim, we apply the proposed feature-based
   framework and deep neural networks including an EEG-optimized temporal
   convolutional network (TCN) to the task of pathological versus
   non-pathological EEG classification. For a robust comparison, we chose
   the Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG Corpus (v2.0.0), which
   contains approximately 3000 EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that
   the proposed featurebased decoding framework can achieve accuracies on
   the same level as state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find
   accuracies across both approaches in an astonishingly narrow range from
   81 to 86\%. Moreover, visualizations and analyses indicated that both
   approaches used similar aspects of the data, e.g., delta and theta band
   power at temporal electrode locations. We argue that the accuracies of
   current binary EEG pathology decoders could saturate near 90\% due to
   the imperfect inter-rater agreement of the clinical labels, and that
   such decoders are already clinically useful, such as in areas where
   clinical EEG experts are rare. We make the proposed feature-based
   framework available open source and thus offer a new tool for EEG
   machine learning research.},

Title = {Long-term characterization of the Flinders Sensitive Line rodent model

Volume = {300},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The etiology of depression is unknown but has been associated with
   dysregulation of neuronal activity at numerous loci on the
   limbic-cortical circuitry. The Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) is a
   validated rodent model of human depression with spontaneously emerging
   behavioral and physiological phenotype, however, the durability and
   robustness of the phenotypes have not been described. The objective of
   the current study was to evaluate longitudinal dynamics of the
   depressive-like symptoms in this animal model. FSL and control rats of
   both genders were assessed over 8 months, characterizing their
   performance at different time points on motor, sensorimotor and complex
   learning/memory based tasks. Changes over time in physiological
   parameters, such as corticosterone and blood glucose levels, were
   monitored. Regional glucose metabolism, used as a marker of neuronal
   activity, was assessed at different time points using F18-FDG Positron
   Emission Tomography (PET). Results show that certain deficits at 2-3
   months-on tests such as the Elevated Plus Maze, Object Recognition, and
   the Forced Swim Test-were transitory and the phenotype was no longer
   present when re-testing at 6-7 months of age. However, a stable
   impairment was detected on a learning and memory task, particularly
   indicating dysfunction in retention of spatial information. Furthermore,
   at multiple time points, the PET scan indicated a significate bilateral,
   hypo-metabolism in the temporal lobes in the FSL rats compared to
   healthy controls. The data suggests possible alterations of entorhinal
   cortex metabolism concomitant with specific behavioral changes and
   supports the importance of understanding the dynamics and the time and
   gender dependence of the phenotypes present. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Novel desiccant-based very low humidity indicator for condition
   monitoring in miniaturized hermetic packages of active implants},
Journal = {SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {322},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Hermetic packaging is a suitable means to achieve long lifetime for
   implantable medical devices. In order to determine the time to failure
   of the hermetic packages, the prediction of lifetime by helium leakage
   measurements prior to implantation is state of the art. However, these
   methods are not applicable to packages with very small internal cavity
   volumes, as these established methods reach their resolution limits in
   this case. In these packages, even the smallest amounts of water can
   lead to corrosion or short circuits and thus to a malfunctioning system
   with unexpected behavior. Online monitoring of humidity offers the
   advantage that critical conditions are detected before a failure occurs.
   A typical maximum limit is 5000 ppm water vapor inside the package,
   which corresponds to a relative humidity of around 8.1 \%RH at 37
   degrees C. This paper presents the design and implementation of
   capacitive micromachined humidity detectors with a desiccant-based
   dielectric in different designs. These allow the electrical detection of
   moisture absorption, especially in the very low humidity regimen <= 8
   \%RH. For this humidity range design-dependent sensitivities of 0.08
   pF/\%RH and 0.25 pF/\%RH were achieved. Presented sensor devices
   facilitate active monitoring of current moisture content in the package
   cavity and at the same time provide a buffer for ingressing moisture,
   thus increasing the overall lifetime of the system. The current sensors
   are designed for miniaturized active medical implants, but can also be
   transferred to distributed sensors in harsh environments for Internet of
   Things applications or machine condition monitoring in Industry 4.0
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we aim to optimize piezoelectric plate receivers for
   acoustic power transfer applications by analyzing the influence of the
   losses and of the acoustic boundary conditions. We derive the analytic
   expressions of the efficiency of the receiver with the optimal electric
   loads attached, and analyze the maximum efficiency value and its
   frequency with different loss and acoustic boundary conditions. To
   validate the analytical expressions that we have derived, we perform
   experiments in water with composite transducers of different filling
   fractions, and see that a lower acoustic impedance mismatch can
   compensate the influence of large dielectric and acoustic losses to
   achieve a good performance. Finally, we briefly compare the advantages
   and drawbacks of composite transducers and pure PZT (lead zirconate
   titanate) plates as acoustic power receivers, and conclude that 1-3
   composites can achieve similar efficiency values in low power
   applications due to their adjustable acoustic impedance.},

Title = {Working Memory in Schizophrenia: Behavioral and Neural Evidence for
   Reduced Susceptibility to Item-Specific Proactive Interference},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {76},
Number = {6},
Pages = {486-494},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background: Susceptibility to item-specific proactive interference (PI)
   contributes to interindividual differences in working memory (WM)
   capacity and complex cognition relying on WM. Although WM deficits are a
   well-recognized impairment in schizophrenia, the underlying
   pathophysiological effects on specific WM control functions, such as the
   ability to resist item-specific PI, remain unknown. Moreover, opposing
   hypotheses on increased versus reduced PI susceptibility in
   schizophrenia are both justifiable by the extant literature.
   Methods: To provide first insights into the behavioral and neural
   correlates of PI-related WM control in schizophrenia, a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging experiment was conducted in a sample of 20
   patients and 20 well-matched control subjects. Demands on item-specific
   PI were experimentally manipulated in a recent-probes task (three runs,
   64 trials each) requiring subjects to encode and maintain a set of four
   target items per trial.
   Results: Compared with healthy control subjects, schizophrenia patients
   showed a significantly reduced PI susceptibility in both accuracy and
   latency measures. Notably, reduced PI susceptibility in schizophrenia
   was not associated with overall WM impairments and thus constituted an
   independent phenomenon. In addition, PI-related activations in inferior
   frontal gyrus and anterior insula, typically assumed to support PI
   resistance, were reduced in schizophrenia, thus ruling out increased
   neural efforts as a potential cause of the patients' reduced PI
   susceptibility.
   Conclusions: The present study provides first evidence for a diminished
   vulnerability of schizophrenia patients to item-specific PI, which is
   presumably a consequence of the patients' more efficient clearing of
   previously relevant WM traces and the accordingly reduced likelihood for
   item-specific PI to occur.},

Abstract = {In this review, we provide a brief overview over the current knowledge
   about the role of dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex during
   learning and memory. We discuss work in humans, monkeys, rats, and birds
   in order to provide a basis for comparison across species that might
   help identify crucial features and constraints of the dopaminergic
   system in executive function. Computational models of dopamine function
   are introduced to provide a framework for such a comparison. We also
   provide a brief evolutionary perspective showing that the dopaminergic
   system is highly preserved across mammals. Even birds, following a
   largely independent evolution of higher cognitive abilities, have
   evolved a comparable dopaminergic system. Finally, we discuss the unique
   advantages and challenges of using different animal models for advancing
   our understanding of dopamine function in the healthy and diseased
   brain.},

Abstract = {We present a forward-looking OCT probe featuring a piezoelectric tube
   actuated resonant fiber scanner providing a field-of-view of up to 1.8
   mm with a lateral resolution of 12 mu m. The fully packaged final probe
   has a total length of 11.3 mm and an outer diameter of 4 mm. The probe
   is designed to operate in contact mode, and can further be shortened by
   more than 30 \%, if configured to operate at a distance from tissue. The
   scanning fiber bears at its tip a plano-convex imaging lens of 1 mm
   diameter and 0.6 mm focal length. The two components are assembled via
   an ultra-high-precision holder, fabricated by a two-photon
   polymerization based 3D printing tool. This method provides an alignment
   accuracy better than 1 mu m along all axes of the scanning fiber,
   leading to a good control of both the imaging parameters and the scan
   pattern around the resonance peak. Furthermore, using a plano-convex
   lens instead of a GRIN lens provides the same optical functionality
   within a significantly shorter length and facilitates further
   miniaturization. Using this probe, we demonstrate 3D OCT measurements of
   standard calibration targets and in-vivo tissue measurements performed
   on human skin.},

Title = {Extending the Cortical Grasping Network: Pre-supplementary Motor Neuron
   Activity During Vision and Grasping of Objects},
Journal = {CEREBRAL CORTEX},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {12},
Pages = {4435-4449},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Grasping relies on a network of parieto-frontal areas lying on the
   dorsolateral and dorsomedial parts of the hemispheres. However, the
   initiation and sequencing of voluntary actions also requires the
   contribution of mesial premotor regions, particularly the
   pre-supplementary motor area F6. We recorded 233 F6 neurons from 2
   monkeys with chronic linear multishank neural probes during
   reaching-grasping visuomotor tasks. We showed that F6 neurons play a
   role in the control of forelimb movements and some of them (26\%)
   exhibit visual and/or motor specificity for the target object.
   Interestingly, area F6 neurons form 2 functionally distinct populations,
   showing either visually-triggered or movement-related bursts of
   activity, in contrast to the sustained visual-to-motor activity
   displayed by ventral premotor area F5 neurons recorded in the same
   animals and with the same task during previous studies. These findings
   suggest that F6 plays a role in object grasping and extend existing
   models of the cortical grasping network.},

Abstract = {We report on a compact optrode, i.e. a MEMS-based, invasive,
   bidirectional neural interface allowing to control neural activity using
   light while neural signals are recorded nearby. The optrode consists of
   a silicon (Si) base carrying two pairs of bare laser diodes (LDs)
   emitting at 650 nm and of two 8 mm-long, 250 mu m-wide and down to 50 mu
   m-thick shanks extending from the base. Each LD is efficiently coupled
   to one of four 15 or 20 mu m-wide and 13 mu m-high SU-8 waveguides (WGs)
   running in pairs along the shanks. In addition, each shank comprises
   four 20 mu m-diameter platinum electrodes for neural recording near the
   WG end facets. After encapsulation of the LDs with a Si cover chip
   blocking stray light and protecting the LDs from the harsh environment
   to which the probe is destined, the compact base measures only 4 x 4 x
   0.43 mm(3). The time averaged radiant emittance at the WG end facet is
   96.9 mW mm(-2) for an LD current of 35 mA at a duty cycle of 5\%. The
   absolute electrode impedance at 1 kHz is 1.54 +/- 0.06 M Omega. Using
   infrared thermography, the temperature increase of the probe during LD
   operation was determined to be about 1 K under neuroscientifically
   relevant operating conditions.},

Abstract = {Robots operating in populated environments encounter many different
   types of people, some of whom might have an advanced need for cautious
   interaction, because of physical impairments or their advanced age.
   Robots therefore need to recognize such advanced demands to provide
   appropriate assistance, guidance or other forms of support. In this
   paper, we propose a depth-based perception pipeline that estimates the
   position and velocity of people in the environment and categorizes them
   according to the mobility aids they use: pedestrian, person in
   wheelchair, person in a wheelchair with a person pushing them, person
   with crutches and person using a walker. We present a fast region
   proposal method that feeds a Region-based Convolutional Network (Fast
   RCNN {[}1]). With this, we speed up the object detection process by a
   factor of seven compared to a dense sliding window approach. We
   furthermore propose a probabilistic position, velocity and class
   estimator to smooth the CNN's detections and account for occlusions and
   misclassifications. In addition, we introduce a new hospital dataset
   with over 17,000 annotated RGB-D images. Extensive experiments confirm
   that our pipeline successfully keeps track of people and their mobility
   aids, even in challenging situations with multiple people from different
   categories and frequent occlusions.},

Abstract = {Long-term stability of neural interfaces is a challenge that has still
   to be overcome. In this study, we manufactured a highly stable
   multi-layer thin-film class of carbon-based devices for
   electrocorticography (ECoG) incorporating silicon carbide (SiC) and
   amorphous carbon (DLC) as adhesion promoters between glassy carbon (GC)
   electrodes and polyimide (PI) substrate and between PI and platinum (Pt)
   traces. We aged the thin-film electrodes in 30 mM H2O2 at 39 degrees C
   for one week - to mimic the effects of post-surgery inflammatory
   reaction - and subsequently stressed them with 2500 CV cycles. We
   additionally performed stability tests stimulating the electrodes with
   15 million biphasic pulses. Finally, we implanted the electrodes for 6
   weeks into rat models and optically characterized the explanted devices.
   Results show that the fabricated ECoG devices were able to withstand the
   in vitro and in vivo tests without significant change in impedance and
   morphology.},

Abstract = {Driving activity patterns in the brain to desired levels is an important
   therapeutic strategy for many neurological disorders. The highly dynamic
   nature of neuronal networks and changes with disease progression create
   an urgent need for closed-loop control. Without adequate mathematical
   models of such complex networks, it remains unclear how tractable
   control problems can be formulated and solved for neurobiological
   systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising tool to address such
   challenges, but has rarely been used for the long-term control of live,
   plastic neural networks. This is a difficult problem since it requires
   the controller to adapt to poorly characterized non-stationary
   background processes that alter stimulus-response relations over time.
   We captured these challenges in a novel control task, defined as
   clamping response strengths to predefined levels over long durations in
   a living model system, namely generic BNNs in vitro grown on
   microelectrode arrays. We show that by defining appropriate state-action
   spaces and employing powerful nonlinear RL methods such as Deep RL,
   adaptivity to non-stationary background processes can be achieved in a
   series of experiments: In 27/29 networks, the learned controllers were
   able to improve performance compared to a random and a (linear) LSPI
   controller by a large margin. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Should patients with brain implants undergo MRI?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Patients suffering from neuronal degenerative diseases are increasingly
   being equipped with neural implants to treat symptoms or restore
   functions and increase their quality of life. Magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) would be the modality of choice for the diagnosis and compulsory
   postoperative monitoring of such patients. However, interactions between
   the magnetic resonance (MR) environment and implants pose severe health
   risks to the patient. Nevertheless, neural implant recipients regularly
   undergo MRI examinations, and adverse events are rarely reported.
   However, this should not imply that the procedures are safe. More than
   300 000 cochlear implant recipients are excluded from MRI, unless the
   indication outweighs the excruciating pain. For 75 000 deep brain
   stimulation (DBS) recipients quite the opposite holds true: MRI is
   considered an essential part of the implantation procedure and some
   medical centres deliberately exceed safety regulations, which they refer
   to as crucially impractical. Permanent MRI-related neurological
   dysfunctions in DBS recipients have occurred in the past when
   manufacturer recommendations were exceeded. Within the last few decades,
   extensive effort has been invested to identify, characterise and
   quantify the occurring interactions. Yet today we are still far from a
   satisfying solution concerning a safe and beneficial MR procedure for
   all implant recipients. To contribute, we intend to raise awareness of
   the growing concern, summon the community to stop absurdities and
   instead improve the situation for the increasing number of patients.
   Therefore, we review implant safety in the MRI literature from an
   engineering point of view, with a focus on cochlear and DBS implants as
   success stories of neural implants in clinical practice. We briefly
   explain fundamental phenomena which can lead to patient harm, and point
   out breakthroughs and errors made. Then, we end with conclusions and
   strategies to avoid future implants from being contraindicated in MR
   examinations. We believe that implant recipients should enter MRI, but
   before doing so, it should be made sure that the procedure is
   reasonable.},

Abstract = {Thin-film neural devices are an appealing alternative to traditional
   implants, although their chronic stability remains matter of
   investigation. In this study, a chronically stable class of thin-film
   devices for electrocorticography is manufactured incorporating silicon
   carbide and diamond-like carbon as adhesion promoters between glassy
   carbon (GC) electrodes and polyimide and between GC and platinum traces.
   The devices are aged in three solutions-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
   30 x 10(-3) and 150 x10(-3) M H2O2/PBS-and stressed using cyclic
   voltammetry (2500 cycles) and 20 million biphasic pulses.
   Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and image analysis are
   performed to detect eventual changes of the electrodes morphology.
   Results demonstrate that the devices are able to undergo chemically
   induced oxidative stress and electrical stimulation without failing but
   actually improving their electrical performance until a steady state is
   reached. Additionally, cell viability tests are carried out to verify
   the noncytotoxicity of the materials, before chronically implanting them
   into rat models. The behavior of the GC electrodes in vivo is monitored
   through EIS and sensorimotor evoked potential recordings which confirm
   that, with GC being activated, impedance lowers and quality of recorded
   signal improves. Histological analysis of the brain tissue is performed
   and shows no sign of severe immune reaction to the implant.},

Abstract = {The amygdala and the hippocampus are two adjacent structures in the
   medial temporal lobe that have been broadly investigated in functional
   and structural neuroimaging due to their central importance in sensory
   perception, emotion, and memory. Exact demarcation of the
   amygdalo-hippocampal border (AHB) is, however, difficult in conventional
   structural imaging. Recent evidence suggests that, due to this
   difficulty, functional activation sites with high probability of being
   located in the hippocampus may erroneously be assigned to the amygdala,
   and vice versa. In the present study, we investigated the potential of
   ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in single sessions for
   detecting the AHB in humans. We show for the first time the detailed
   structure of the AHB as it can be visualized in T1-weighted 7T in vivo
   images at 0.5-mm(3) isotropic resolution. Compared to data acquired at
   3T, 7T images revealed considerably more structural detail in the AHB
   region. Thus, we observed a striking inter-hemispheric and
   interindividual variability of the exact anatomical configuration of the
   AHB that points to the necessity of individual imaging of the AHB as a
   prerequisite for accurate anatomical assignment in this region. The
   findings of the present study demonstrate the usefulness of
   ultra-high-field structural MRI to resolve anatomical ambiguities of the
   human AHB. Highly accurate morphometric and functional investigations in
   this region at 7T may allow addressing such hitherto unexplored issues
   as whether the structural configuration of the AHB is related to
   functional differences in amygdalo-hippocampal interaction. Hum Brain

Abstract = {New technologies, such as fiber photometry, can overcome long-standing
   methodological limitations and promote a better understanding of
   neuronal mechanisms. This study, for the first time, aimed at employing
   the newly available dopamine indicator (GRAB(DA2m)) in combination with
   this novel imaging technique. Here, we present a detailed methodological
   roadmap leading to longitudinal repetitive transmitter release
   monitoring in in vivo freely moving animals and provide proof-of-concept
   data. This novel approach enables a fresh look at dopamine release
   patterns in the nucleus accumbens, following the medial forebrain bundle
   (mfb) DBS in a rodent model. Our results suggest reliable readouts of
   dopamine levels over at least 14 days of DBS-induced photometric
   measurements. We show that mfb-DBS can elicit an increased dopamine
   response during stimulation (5 s and 20 s DBS) compared to its baseline
   dopamine activity state, reaching its maximum peak amplitude in about 1
   s and then recovering back after stimulation. The effect of different
   DBS pulse widths (PWs) also suggests a potential differential effect on
   this neurotransmitter response, but future studies would need to verify
   this. Using the described approach, we aim to gain insights into the
   differences between pathological and healthy models and to elucidate
   more exhaustively the mechanisms under which DBS exerts its therapeutic
   action.},

Abstract = {Deep convolutional networks have proven to be very successful in
   learning task specific features that allow for unprecedented performance
   on various computer vision tasks. Training of such networks follows
   mostly the supervised learning paradigm, where sufficiently many
   input-output pairs are required for training. Acquisition of large
   training sets is one of the key challenges, when approaching a new task.
   In this paper, we aim for generic feature learning and present an
   approach for training a convolutional network using only unlabeled data.
   To this end, we train the network to discriminate between a set of
   surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety
   of transformations to a randomly sampled `seed' image patch. In contrast
   to supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is
   not class specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations
   that have been applied during training. This generic feature
   representation allows for classification results that outperform the
   state of the art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets
   (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101, Caltech-256). While features learned
   with our approach cannot compete with class specific features from
   supervised training on a classification task, we show that they are
   advantageous on geometric matching problems, where they also outperform
   the SIFT descriptor.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the development, characterization and in vivo
   validation of compact optical neural probes. These novel intracerebral
   devices comprise micro light-emitting diodes (mu LEDs) integrated along
   their slender probe shanks with up to 20 mu LEDs per device. Blue light
   with a peak wavelength of 455 nm is emitted from circular apertures 100
   mu m in diameter. The mu LEDs are structured on GaN-on-sapphire wafers
   and subsequently transferred onto silicon (Si) carrier wafers. The
   wafer-scale transfer process provides the opportunity to process the
   functional GaN layer stack from both sides and hence enables maximizing
   the efficiency of the mu LEDs. Combined with standard MEMS fabrication
   processes for Si, linear mu LED arrays with small inter-mu LED distances
   are achieved on thin probe shanks with cross-sections measuring 150 mu m
   x 65 mu m. Devices are interconnected using highly flexible polyimide
   cables in order to mechanically decouple them from the peripheral
   electronics during in vivo experiments. Assembled probes emit a peak
   optical radiant flux of 440 mu W (emittance 56mW mm-2) at 5mA driving
   current. Thermal characterization of test probes reveals a temperature
   increase of 1.5K measured using an integrated thermistor. Electrical
   functionality stress tests have been carried out to evaluate the device
   passivation against the physiological environment. It is estimated to
   endure at least 48 h during continuously pulsed mu LED operation. A
   compact driving circuitry enables low-noise mu LED operation in in vivo
   optogenetic experiments. The radiant flux necessary to elicit an
   acceptable neuronal response is determined between 1.36 mu Wand 17.5 mu
   W. Probe validation successfully demonstrates the layer-specific
   stimulation in the cortex in multiple in vivo trials.},

   performed with an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system
   incorporating an akinetic light source with a center wavelength of 1300

   operates in contact mode to avoid motion artifacts, in particular,
   beneficial for OCTA measurements, and achieves a transversal resolution
   of 12 m in air at a rigid probe size of 4 mm in diameter and 11.3 mm in
   length. A spiral scan pattern is generated at a scanning frequency of
   360 Hz to sample a maximum field of view of 1.3 mm. OCT images of a
   human finger as well as visualization of microvasculature of the human
   palm are presented both in two and three dimensions. The combination of
   morphological tissue contrast with qualitative dynamic blood flow

Abstract = {Resting-state networks have become an important tool for the study of
   brain function. An ultra-fast imaging technique that allows to measure
   brain function, called Magnetic Resonance Encephalography (MREG),
   achieves an order of magnitude higher temporal resolution than standard
   echo-planar imaging (EPI). This new sequence helps to correct
   physiological artifacts and improves the sensitivity of the fMRI
   analysis. In this study, EPI is compared with MREG in terms of
   capability to extract resting-state networks. Healthy controls underwent
   two consecutive resting-state scans, one with EPI and the other with
   MREG. Subject-level independent component analyses (ICA) were performed
   separately for each of the two datasets. Using Stanford FIND atlas
   parcels as network templates, the presence of ICA maps corresponding to
   each network was quantified in each subject. The number of detected
   individual networks was significantly higher in the MREG data set than
   for EPI. Moreover, using short time segments of MREG data, such as 50
   seconds, one can still detect and track consistent networks. Fast fMRI
   thus results in an increased capability to extract distinct functional
   regions at the individual subject level for the same scan times, and
   also allow the extraction of consistent networks within shorter time
   intervals than when using EPI, which is notably relevant for the
   analysis of dynamic functional connectivity fluctuations. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {ObjectiveSpatial neglect can either spontaneously resolve or persist
   after stroke; the latter is associated with a poorer outcome. We aimed
   to investigate the neural correlates and predictors of favorable versus
   poor recovery from neglect in acute stroke.
   MethodsIn addition to neuropsychological testing, we explored
   task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging activation and
   functional connectivity in 34 patients with neglect and/or extinction.
   Patients were examined at 2 to 3 days (acute phase I) and 8 to 10 days
   (acute phase II), and some of them at 4 to 6 months (chronic phase)
   poststroke.
   ResultsCourse of recovery was predicted by the strength of functional
   connectivity between the right parietal and left prefrontal and parietal
   regions, as early as acute phase I. During acute phase II, favorable
   recovery from neglect was associated with increased activation in the
   left prefrontal and right parietal regions, an effect not observed at
   any time point in patients with poor acute recovery. The extent of
   neglect amelioration correlated with activation gain in the right
   attention centers; stronger activation of their left functional
   homologues correlated with better spatial processing in the neglected
   hemispace during both of the acute examination phases.
   InterpretationSystem excitability and early recruitment of
   contralesional functional homologues represented specific features of
   favorable recovery in acute stroke. In severe strokes leading to
   neglect, contralesional functional homologues support recovery by
   modulating the preserved ipsilesional network, and initial functional
   connectivity between them might predict recovery course and help to
   identify patients with potentially poor recovery requiring more
   intensive early rehabilitation. Ann Neurol 2016;79:673-686},

Title = {Chronic deep brain stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle reverses
   depressive-like behavior in a hemiparkinsonian rodent model},

Abstract = {Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that depression might be
   associated with a dysfunction in the reward/motivation circuitry. Deep
   brain stimulation (DBS) of the superolateral branch of the medial
   forebrain bundle (MFB) has been shown in a recent clinical trial to
   provide a prompt and consistent improvement of depressive symptoms in
   treatment-resistant patients. In order to better understand the
   underlying mechanisms of neuromodulation in the context of depression,
   the effects of chronic bilateral MFB-DBS were assessed in a combined
   rodent model of depression and Parkinson's disease. Female
   Sprague-Dawley rats received unilateral 6-OHDA injection in the right
   MFB and were divided into three groups: CMS-STIM, CMS-noSTIM and control
   group. The CMS groups were submitted to chronic unpredictable mild
   stress (CMS) protocol for 6 weeks. MFB-DBS was applied only to the
   CMS-STIM group for 1 week. All groups were repeatedly probed on a series
   of behavioral tasks following each intervention, and to a postmortem
   histological analysis. CMS led to an increase in immobility in the
   forced swim test, to a decrease in sucrose solution consumption in the
   sucrose preference test, as well as to an increased production of
   ultrasonic vocalizations in the 22 kHz range, indicating increased
   negative affect. MFB-DBS reversed the anhedonic-like and despair-like
   behaviors. The results suggest that unilateral dopamine depletion did
   not preclude MFB-DBS in reversing depressive-like and anhedonic-like

Abstract = {The spatial distribution of neurons and activity-dependent neurite
   outgrowth shape long-range interaction, recurrent local connectivity and
   the modularity in neuronal networks. We investigated how this mesoscale
   architecture develops by interaction of neurite outgrowth, cell
   migration and activity in cultured networks of rat cortical neurons and
   show that simple rules can explain variations of network modularity. In
   contrast to theoretical studies on activity-dependent outgrowth but
   consistent with predictions for modular networks, spontaneous activity
   and the rate of synchronized bursts increased with clustering, whereas
   peak firing rates in bursts increased in highly interconnected
   homogeneous networks. As Ca2+ influx increased exponentially with
   increasing network recruitment during bursts, its modulation was highly
   correlated to peak firing rates. During network maturation, long-term
   estimates of Ca(2+)influx showed convergence, even for highly different
   mesoscale architectures, neurite extent, connectivity, modularity and
   average activity levels, indicating homeostatic regulation towards a
   common set-point of Ca2+ influx.},

Abstract = {Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is the most common focal epilepsy
   in adults and is often refractory to medication. So far, resection of
   the epileptogenic focus represents the only curative therapy. It is
   unknown whether pathological processes preceding epilepsy onset are
   indicators of later disease severity. Using longitudinal multi-modal
   MRI, we monitored hippocampal injury and tissue reorganization during
   epileptogenesis in a mouse mTLE model. The prognostic value of MRI
   biomarkers was assessed by retrospective correlations with pathological
   hallmarks Here, we show for the first time that the extent of early
   hippocampal neurodegeneration and progressive microstructural changes in
   the dentate gyrus translate to the severity of hippocampal sclerosis and
   seizure burden in chronic epilepsy. Moreover, we demonstrate that
   structural MRI biomarkers reflect the extent of sclerosis in human
   hippocampi. Our findings may allow an early prognosis of disease
   severity in mTLE before its first clinical manifestations, thus
   expanding the therapeutic window.},

Title = {Musicians use speech-specific areas when processing tones: The key to
   their superior linguistic competence?},
Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {390},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {It is known that musicians compared to non-musicians have some superior
   speech and language competence, yet the mechanisms how musical training
   leads to this advantage are not well specified.
   This event-related fMRI study confirmed that musicians outperformed
   non-musicians in processing not only of musical tones but also syllables
   and identified a network differentiating musicians from non-musicians
   during processing of linguistic sounds.
   Within this network, the activation of bilateral superior temporal gyrus
   was shared with all subjects during processing of the acoustically
   well-matched musical and linguistic sounds, and with the activation
   distinguishing tones with a complex harmonic spectrum (bowed tone) from
   a simpler one (plucked tone). These results confirm that better speech
   processing in musicians relies on improved cross-domain spectral
   analysis.
   Activation of left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), premotor
   cortex, inferior frontal and fusiform gyrus (FG) also distinguishing
   musicians from non-musicians during syllable processing overlapped with
   the activation segregating linguistic from musical sounds in all
   subjects. Since these brain-regions were not involved during tone
   processing in non-musicians, they could code for functions which are
   specialized for speech. Musicians recruited pSTS and FG during tone
   processing, thus these speech-specialized brain-areas processed musical
   sounds in the presence of musical training.
   This study shows that the linguistic advantage of musicians is linked
   not only to improved cross-domain spectral analysis, but also to the
   functional adaptation of brain resources that are specialized for
   speech, but accessible to the domain of music in the presence of musical
   training.},

Abstract = {This study reports on a fully autonomous system comprising a wireless
   headstage and an array of micro light-emitting diodes (mu LED)
   integrated in a flexible neural probe for optogenetic experiments. The
   49 mu LEDs (50x50 mu m(2)) are arranged at a minimal pitch of only 100
   mu m. The mu LED-based neural probes are realized using a novel,
   single-sided fabrication process on the expitaxial sapphire substrate
   that avoids the delicate mu LED transfer using wafer bonding and laser
   lift-off. The absolute optical power per mu LED is 1.1 mW at 465 nm peak
   wavelength, resulting in an emittance of more than 500 mW/mm(2) at the
   mu LED surface. The mu LEDs of the optical neural probes are powered and
   controlled by a compact (diameter 18.7 mm, height 19.8 mm), light-weight
   (6.44 g), modular headstage. It enables the simultaneous operation of
   multiple probes serially addressing up to two arrays with each up to
   16x16 mu LEDs for about 2 h under continuous operation.},

   aims to develop smart devices to interface with the brain. Among these,
   closed-loop stimulation devices promise new chances for patients
   suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy, assuming that effective
   stimulation parameters can be found. As the mechanisms of electrical
   brain stimulations are complex and poorly understood, animal experiments
   are needed to obtain insight into optimal parameter settings. Besides
   these, the loop can only be closed by reliable seizure detection and
   prediction algorithms with high performance and at the same time low
   computational complexity. We present our results in this respect, based
   on the widely accepted kainate model, thought to resemble human temporal
   lobe epilepsy. More than 400 seizures could be recorded in more than
   2500 h of synchronized video-EEG-acquisition. Video- and EEG-based
   detection algorithms were programmed and seizure prediction methods
   tested. Those with the best performance in regard to reliability,
   celerity and power consumption will be used in a closed-loop setup. This
   is a first step to evaluate closed-loop stimulation approaches and
   therewith widening possibilities for future clinical applications.},

Abstract = {This review presents a practical primer for functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS) with respect to technology, experimentation, and
   analysis software. Its purpose is to jump-start interested practitioners
   considering utilizing a non-invasive, versatile, nevertheless
   challenging window into the brain using optical methods. We briefly
   recapitulate relevant anatomical and optical foundations and give a
   short historical overview. We describe competing types of illumination
   (trans-illumination, reflectance, and differential reflectance) and data
   collection methods (continuous wave, time domain and frequency domain).
   Basic components (light sources, detection, and recording components) of
   fNIRS systems are presented. Advantages and limitations of fNIRS
   techniques are offered, followed by a list of very practical
   recommendations for its use. A variety of experimental and clinical
   studies with fNIRS are sampled, shedding light on many brain-related
   ailments. Finally, we describe and discuss a number of freely available
   analysis and presentation packages suited for data analysis. In
   conclusion, we recommend fNIRS due to its ever-growing body of clinical
   applications, state-of-the-art neuroimaging technique and manageable
   hardware requirements. It can be safely concluded that fNIRS adds a new
   arrow to the quiver of neuro-medical examinations due to both its great
   versatility and limited costs.},

Abstract = {After the development of a single-sided fabrication process for
   intrafascicular parylene C based electrode arrays tests showed that an
   increase in integration density can only be achieved by a double-side
   process. The process uses 25 mu m thick platinum iridium foil, which is
   thinned down with the laser and sandwiched between two 10 mu m thick
   parylene C layers. Utilizing a picosecond laser (355 nm Nd: YVO4) it was
   possible to fabricate 40 mu m thick electrodes that can be implanted
   directly in the nerve without relying on additional support layers like
   chitosan or silk. The fabricated samples feature three 80 mu m diameter
   electrodes on each side and a large ground electrode that is opened to
   both sides. Impedance mismatches from front to back side as a result of
   the fabrication process are compensated by electrochemical deposition of
   nanostructured platinum. This step makes it possible to bring the
   impedances of the small electrodes down to the range of just a few kO at
   1 kHz and illustrate the additionally gained surface due to the
   picosecond laser ablation on the front side electrodes. The safely
   injectable charge per pulse was found to be 635.75 mu C/cm(2) for such
   coated electrodes. Optical investigations show that this fabrication
   process offers an alternative to established lithographic processes for
   thin and flexible electrode arrays in neural implants.},

Title = {Feasibility and Safety of Continuous and Chronic Bilateral Deep Brain
   Stimulation of the Medial Forebrain Bundle in the Naive Sprague-Dawley
   Rat},
Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the superolateral branch of
   the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) has provided rapid and dramatic
   reduction of depressive symptoms in a clinical trial. Early intracranial
   self-stimulation experiments of theMFB suggested detrimental side
   effects on the animals' health; therefore, the current study looked at
   the viability of chronic and continuous MFB-DBS in rodents, with
   particular attention given to welfare issues and identification of
   stimulated pathways. Methods. Sprague-Dawley female rats were submitted
   to stereotactic microelectrode implantation into the MFB. Chronic
   continuous DBS was applied for 3-6 weeks. Welfare monitoring and
   behavior changes were assessed. Postmortem histological analysis of
   c-fos protein expression was carried out. Results. MFB-DBS resulted in
   mild and temporary weight loss in the animals, which was regained even
   with continuing stimulation. MFB-DBS led to increased and long-lasting
   c-fos expression in target regions of the mesolimbic/mesocortical
   system. Conclusions. Bilateral continuous chronic MFB-DBS is feasible,
   safe, and without impact on the rodent's health. MFB-DBS results in
   temporary increase in exploration, which could explain the initial
   weight loss, and does not produce any apparent behavioral abnormalities.
   This platformrepresents a powerful tool for further preclinical
   investigation of the MFB stimulation in the treatment of depression.},

Title = {Age differences in behavioral and neural correlates of proactive
   interference: Disentangling the role of overall working memory
   performance},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {376-386},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Reliable performance in working memory (WM) critically depends on the
   ability to resist proactive interference (PI) from previously relevant
   WM contents. Both WM performance and PI susceptibility are subject to
   cognitive decline at older adult age. However, the behavioral and neural
   processes underlying these co-evolving developmental changes and their
   potential interdependencies are not yet understood. Here, we
   investigated PI using a recent-probes WM paradigm and functional MRI in
   a cross-sectional sample of younger (n = 18, 10 female, 23.4 +/- 2.7
   years) and older adults (n = 18, 10 female, 70.2 +/- 2.7 years). As
   expected, older adults showed lower WM performance and higher PI
   susceptibility than younger adults. Resolution of PI activated a mainly
   bilateral frontal network across all participants. Significant
   interactions with age indicated reduced neural activation in older
   adults for PI resolution. A second analysis in a selection of younger
   and older adults (n = 12 each) with matched WM performance also revealed
   significant differences in PI between both age groups and - on a
   descriptive level - again a hypo-activation of the older adults' PI
   network. But the differential effect of age on the neural PI effects did
   not reach significance in this smaller sample most likely to the reduced
   statistical power. However, given the highly similar patterns in both
   the overall and the WM-matched samples, we propose that the
   hypo-activation of the PI network in the older adults may not be
   attributable to age-related differences in overall WM performance, hence
   suggesting that higher PI susceptibility in older adult age does not
   directly depend on their lowerWM performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Objective. Microfabricated neuroprosthetic devices have made possible
   important observations on neuron activity; however, long-term
   high-fidelity recording performance of these devices has yet to be
   realized. Tissue-device interactions appear to be a primary source of
   lost recording performance. The current state of the art for visualizing
   the tissue response surrounding brain implants in animals is
   immunohistochemistry + confocal microscopy, which is mainly performed
   after sacrificing the animal. Monitoring the tissue response as it
   develops could reveal important features of the response which may
   inform improvements in electrode design. Approach. Optical coherence
   tomography (OCT), an imaging technique commonly used in ophthalmology,
   has already been adapted for imaging of brain tissue. Here, we use OCT
   to achieve real-time, in vivo monitoring of the tissue response
   surrounding chronically implanted neural devices. The employed
   tissue-response-provoking implants are coated with a plasma-deposited
   nanofilm, which has been demonstrated as a biocompatible and
   anti-inflammatory interface for indwelling devices. We evaluate the
   method by comparing the OCT results to traditional histology
   qualitatively and quantitatively. Main results. The differences in OCT
   signal across the implantation period between the plasma group and the
   control reveal that the plasma-type coating of otherwise rigid brain
   probes (glass) only slightly improve the glial encapsulation in the
   brain parenchyma indicating that geometrical or mechanical influences
   are dominating the encapsulation process. Significance. Our approach can
   long-term monitor and compare the tissue-response to
   chronically-implanted neural probes with and withour plasma coating in
   living animal models. Our findings provide valuable insigh to the well
   acknowledged yet not solved challenge.},

Abstract = {Penetrating neural probes comprising arrays ofmicroelectrodesare
   commonly used tomonitor local field potentials and multi-unit activity
   in animal brain over time frames of weeks. To correlate these recorded
   signals to specific tissue areas, histological analysis is performed
   after the experimental endpoint. Even if the lesion of the penetrating
   probe shaft can be observed, a precise reconstruction of the exact
   electrode positions is still challenging. To overcome these experimental
   difficulties, we developed a new concept, whereupon recording electrodes
   are coated with a poly (3,
   4-ethylenedioxythiophene/polystyrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS)-based film.
   The conducting polymer acts as dye reservoir over several weeks and
   afterwards provides controlled delivery of neurotracers. This paper
   presents a recording electrode based on a PEDOT/PSS bilayer optimized
   for dye delivery and with reduced impedance. Controlled exchange of
   neurotracer dye is successfully demonstrated in vitro using
   spectrofluorometry and in neuroblastoma cell cultures. A second
   PEDOT/PSS capping layer on top of the dye reservoir lowers the passive
   leakage of dye by a factor of 6.4 and prevents a direct contact of the
   dye filled layer with the cells. Stability tests over four weeks
   demonstrate the electrochemical stability of the PEDOT coating, as well
   as retained functionality of the dye delivery system.},

   using three individually controllable piezo cantilevers. We were able to
   prove the concept for continuously adjustable variable prisms and
   achieved a tilt angle up to +/- 3.7 degrees with a response time of 36

Abstract = {Pathological changes in excitability of cortical tissue commonly
   underlie the initiation and spread of seizure activity in patients
   suffering from epilepsy. Accordingly, monitoring excitability and
   controlling its degree using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is of prime
   importance for clinical care and treatment. To date, adequate measures
   of excitability and action of AEDs have been difficult to identify.
   Recent insights into ongoing cortical activity have identified global
   levels of phase synchronization as measures that characterize normal
   levels of excitability and quantify any deviation therefrom. Here, we
   explore the usefulness of these intrinsic measures to quantify cortical
   excitability in humans. First, we observe a correlation of such markers
   with stimulation-evoked responses suggesting them to be viable
   excitability measures based on ongoing activity. Second, we report a
   significant covariation with the level of AED load and a wake-dependent
   modulation. Our results indicate that excitability in epileptic networks
   is effectively reduced by AEDs and suggest the proposed markers as
   useful candidates to quantify excitability in routine clinical
   conditions overcoming the limitations of electrical or magnetic
   stimulation. The wake-dependent time course of these metrics suggests a
   homeostatic role of sleep, to rebalance cortical excitability.},

Title = {Bifurcation analysis of the dynamics of interacting subnetworks of a
   spiking network},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {We analyze the collective dynamics of hierarchically structured networks
   of densely connected spiking neurons. These networks of sub-networks may
   represent interactions between cell assemblies or different nuclei in
   the brain. The dynamical activity pattern that results from these
   interactions depends on the strength of synaptic coupling between them.
   Importantly, the overall dynamics of a brain region in the absence of
   external input, so called ongoing brain activity, has been attributed to
   the dynamics of such interactions. In our study, two different network
   scenarios are considered: a system with one inhibitory and two
   excitatory subnetworks, and a network representation with three
   inhibitory subnetworks. To study the effect of synaptic strength on the
   global dynamics of the network, two parameters for relative couplings
   between these subnetworks are considered. For each case, a bifurcation
   analysis is performed and the results have been compared to large-scale
   network simulations. Our analysis shows that Generalized Lotka-Volterra
   (GLV) equations, well-known in predator-prey studies, yield a meaningful
   population-level description for the collective behavior of spiking
   neuronal interaction, which have a hierarchical structure. In
   particular, we observed a striking equivalence between the bifurcation
   diagrams of spiking neuronal networks and their corresponding GLV
   equations. This study gives new insight on the behavior of neuronal
   assemblies, and can potentially suggest new mechanisms for altering the
   dynamical patterns of spiking networks based on changing the synaptic
   strength between some groups of neurons.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present and verify the nonlinear simulation of an

   combined bending and buckling actuation. To predict the full nonlinear
   piezoelectric behavior, we measured the nonlinear charge coefficient,
   hysteresis and creep effects of the piezo material and inserted them
   into the ELM model using a virtual electric field. We further included
   and discussed the fabrication parameters-glue layers and thermal
   stress-and their variations. To verify our simulations, we fabricated
   and measured a set of lenses with different geometries, where we found
   good agreement and show that their qualitative behavior is also well
   described by a simple analytical model. We finally discuss the effects
   of the geometry on the electric response and find, e.g. an increased
   focal power range from +/- 4.5 to +/- 9 m(-1) when changing the aperture
   from 14 to 10 mm.},

Title = {Concept and Development of an Electronic Framework Intended for
   Electrode and Surrounding Environment Characterization In Vivo},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There has been substantial progress over the last decade towards
   miniaturizing implantable microelectrodes for use in Active Implantable
   Medical Devices (AIMD). Compared to the rapid development and complexity
   of electrode miniaturization, methods to monitor and assess functional
   integrity and electrical functionality of these electrodes, particularly
   during long term stimulation, have not progressed to the same extent.
   Evaluation methods that form the gold standard, such as stimulus pulse
   testing, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
   are either still bound to laboratory infrastructure (impractical for
   long term in vivo experiments) or deliver no comprehensive insight into
   the material's behaviour. As there is a lack of cost effective and
   practical predictive measures to understand long term electrode
   behaviour in vivo, material investigations need to be performed after
   explantation of the electrodes. We propose the analysis of the electrode
   and its environment in situ, to better understand and correlate the
   effects leading to electrode failure. The derived knowledge shall
   eventually lead to improved electrode designs, increased electrode
   functionality and safety in clinical applications. In this paper, the
   concept, design and prototyping of a sensor framework used to analyse
   the electrode's behaviour and to monitor diverse electrode failure
   mechanisms, even during stimulation pulses, is presented. We focused on
   the electronic circuitry and data acquisition techniques required for a
   conceptual multi-sensor system. Functionality of single modules and a
   prototype framework have been demonstrated, but further work is needed
   to convert the prototype system into an implantable device. In vitro
   studies will be conducted first to verify sensor performance and
   reliability.},

Title = {Somatotopic mapping of natural upper- and lower-extremity movements and

Abstract = {Precise delineation of pathological and eloquent cortices is essential
   in pre-neurosurgical diagnostics of epilepsy. A limitation of existing
   experimental procedures, however, is that they critically require active
   cooperation of the patient, which is not always achievable, particularly
   in infants and in patients with insufficient cognitive abilities. In the
   present study, we evaluated the potential of electrocorticographic
   recordings of high gamma activity during natural, non-experimental
   behavior of epilepsy patients to localize upper- and lower-extremity
   motor and language functions, and compared the results with those
   obtained using electrocortical stimulation. The observed effects were
   highly significant and functionally specific, and agreed well with the
   somatotopic organization of the motor cortex, both on the lateral
   convexity and in the supplementary motor area. Our approach showed a
   similar specificity and sensitivity for extremity movements as
   previously obtained from experimental data. We were able to quantify,
   for the first time, sensitivity and specificity of high gamma underlying
   non-experimental lower-extremity movements in four patients, and
   observed values in the same range as for upper extremities (analyzed in
   six patients). Speech-related responses in the three investigated
   patients, however, exhibited only a very low sensitivity. The present
   findings indicate that localization of not only upper- but also
   lower-extremity movements congruent with electrocortical stimulation
   mapping is possible based on event-related high gamma responses that can
   be observed during natural behavior. Thus, non-experimental mapping may
   be usefully applied as adjunct to established clinical procedures for
   identification of both upper- and lower-extremity motor functions. (C)

Abstract = {Conducting polymers (CPs) have frequently been described as outstanding
   coating materials for neural microelectrodes, providing significantly
   reduced impedance or higher charge injection compared to pure metals.
   Usability has until now, however, been limited by poor adhesion of
   polymers like poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) to metallic
   substrates, ultimately precluding long-term applications. The aim of
   this study was to overcome this weakness of CPs by introducing two novel
   adhesion improvement strategies that can easily be integrated with
   standard microelectrode fabrication processes. Iridium Oxide (IrOx)
   demonstrated exceptional stability for PEDOT coatings, resulting in
   polymer survival over 10 000 redox cycles and 110 days under accelerated
   aging conditions at 60 degrees C. Nanostructured Pt was furthermore
   introduced as a purely mechanical adhesion promoter providing 10-fold
   adhesion improvement compared to smooth Pt substrates by simply altering
   the morphology of Pt. This layer, can be realized in a very simple
   process that is compatible with any electrode design, turning
   nanostructured Pt into a universal adhesion layer for CP coatings. By
   the introduction of these adhesion-promoting strategies, the weakness of
   CP-based neural probes can ultimately be eliminated and true long-term
   stable use of PEDOT on neural probes will be possible in future
   electrode generations.},

Title = {Early seizure detection for closed loop direct neurostimulation devices
   in epilepsy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Current treatment concepts for epilepsy are based on continuous drug
   delivery or electrical stimulation to prevent the occurrence of
   seizures, exposing the brain and body to a mostly unneeded risk of
   adverse effects. To address the infrequent occurrence and short duration
   of epileptic seizures, intelligent implantable closed-loop devices are
   needed which are based on a refined analysis of ongoing brain activity
   with highly specific and fast detection algorithms to allow for timely,
   ictal interventions. Since the development and FDA approval of a first
   closed loop neurostimulation device relying on simple threshold-based
   approaches, machine learning approaches became widely available,
   probably outperformed in the near future by deep convolutional neural
   networks, which already showed to be extremely successful in pattern
   recognition in images and partly in signal analysis. Handcrafted
   features or rules defined by experts become replaced by systematic
   feature selection procedures and systematic hyperparameter search
   approaches. Training of these classifiers augments the need of large
   databases with intracranial EEG recordings, which is partly given by
   existing databases but potentially can be replaced by continuously
   transferring data from implanted devices and their publication for
   research purposes. Already in early design states, the final target
   hardware must be taken into account for algorithm development. Size,
   power consumption and, as a consequence, limited computational resources
   given by low power microcontrollers, FPGAs and ASICS limit the
   complexity of feature computation, classifier complexity, and the
   numbers and complexity of layers of deep neuronal networks. Novel
   approaches for early seizure detection will be a key module for new
   generations of closed-loop devices together with improved low power
   implant hardware and will provide together with more efficient
   intervention paradigms new treatment options for patients with difficult
   to treat epilepsy.},

Abstract = {Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common type of focal
   epilepsy. It is frequently associated with abnormal MRI findings, which
   are caused by underlying cellular, structural, and chemical changes at
   the micro-scale. In the current study, it is investigated to which
   extent these alterations correspond to imaging features detected by high
   resolution magnetic resonance imaging in the intrahippocampal kainate
   mouse model of MTLE. Fixed hippocampal and whole-brain sections of mouse
   brain tissue from nine animals under physiological and chronically
   epileptic conditions were examined using structural and
   diffusion-weighted MRI. Microstructural details were investigated based
   on a direct comparison with immunohistochemical analyses of the same
   specimen. Within the hippocampal formation, diffusion streamlines could
   be visualized corresponding to dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells and
   granule cells, as well as mossy fibers and Schaffer collaterals.
   Statistically significant changes in diffusivities, fractional
   anisotropy, and diffusion orientations could be detected in tissue
   samples from chronically epileptic animals compared to healthy controls,
   corresponding to microstructural alterations (degeneration of pyramidal
   cells, dispersion of the granule cell layer, and sprouting of mossy
   fibers). The diffusion parameters were significantly correlated with
   histologically determined cell densities. These findings demonstrate
   that high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI can resolve subtle
   microstructural changes in epileptic hippocampal tissue corresponding to
   histopathological features in MTLE.},

Title = {Cognitive and behavioral comorbidities in Rolandic epilepsy and their
   relation with default mode network's functional connectivity and
   organization},
Journal = {EPILEPSY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {179-186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is characterized by typical
   interictal-electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns mainly localized in
   centrotemporal and parietooccipital areas. An aberrant intrinsic
   organization of the default mode network (DMN) due to repeated
   disturbances from spike-generating areas may be able to account for
   specific cognitive deficits and behavioral problems in RE. The aim of
   the present study was to investigate cognitive development (CD) and
   socioemotional development (SED) in patients with RE during active
   disease in relation to DMN connectivity and network topology.
   Methods: In 10 children with RE and active EEG, CD was assessed using
   the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV); SED was
   assessed using the Funf-Faktoren-Fragebogen fur Kinder (FFFK), a
   Big-Five inventory for the assessment of personality traits in children.
   Functional connectivity (FC) in the DMN was determined from a 15-minute
   resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and network
   properties were calculated using standard graph-theoretical measures.
   Results: More severe deficits of verbal abilities tended to be
   associated with an earlier age at epilepsy onset, but were not directly
   related to the number of seizures and disease duration. Nonetheless, at
   the network level, disease duration was associated with alterations of
   the efficiency and centrality of parietal network nodes and midline
   structures. Particularly, centrality of the left inferior parietal lobe
   (IPL) was found to be linked with CD. Reduced centrality of the left IPL
   and alterations supporting a rather segregated processing with in DMN's
   subsystems was associated with a more favorable CD. A more complicated
   SED was associated with high seizure frequency and long disease
   duration, and revealed links with a less favorable CD.
   Significance: An impaired CD and - because of their interrelation - SED
   might be mediated by a common pathomechanism reflected in an aberrant
   organization, and thus, a potential functional deficit of the DMN. A
   functional segregation of (left) parietal network nodes from the DMN and
   a rather segregated processing mode within the DMN might have positive
   implications/protective value for CD in patients with RE. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The development of highly accelerated fMRI acquisition techniques has
   led to novel possibilities to monitor cerebral activity non-invasively
   and with unprecedented temporal resolutions. With the emergence of
   dynamic connectivity and its ability to provide a much richer
   characterization of brain function compared to static measures, fast
   fMRI may yet play a crucial role in tracking dynamically varying
   networks. In spite of the dominance of slow hemodynamic contributions to
   the BOLD signal, high temporal sampling rates nevertheless improve the
   measurement of physiological noise, yielding an exceptional sensitivity
   for the detection of periods of transient connectivity at time scales of
   a few tens of seconds. There is also evidence that relevant BOLD
   fluctuations are detectable at high frequencies, implying that the
   benefits of fast fMRI extend beyond the ability to sample nuisance
   confounds. Here we review the latest technological advancements that
   have established fast fMRI as an effective acquisition technique, as
   well as its current and future implications on the analysis of dynamic
   networks.},

Title = {Test-Retest Reliability of the Tower of London Planning Task (TOL-F)},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {925-931},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Test-retest reliability is difficult to establish for measures of
   executive functioning that rely on task novelty. Correspondingly,
   evidence on the test-retest reliability of the commonly used Tower of
   London (TOL) planning task is, as yet, equivocal and only based on
   indices of relative consistency, rather than absolute agreement of
   individual scores. Further, the stability of planning latencies over
   repeated testing has not been investigated. The present study assessed
   test-retest reliability of planning performance measures using a
   structurally balanced problem set implemented in the TOL-Freiburg
   version (TOL-F). The TOL-F was administered in 2 structurally identical
   versions to a sample of young, healthy adults over a 1-week interval.
   For planning accuracy, the Pearson correlation and intraclass
   correlation coefficient for relative consistency were adequate (r = .739
   and .734), with the intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute
   agreement only slightly decreased (r = .690). For initial thinking and
   movement execution times, relative consistency and absolute agreement
   reliability indices were uniformly low (all r between .274 and .519).
   Given adequate planning accuracy test-retest reliability, the TOL-F can
   be reliably used to measure planning ability in group-based studies and
   with individual participants, as is important for clinical testing.
   Planning latencies, however, should only be used as complementary, but
   not sole measures of planning ability, particularly for normative
   evaluations in clinical assessment. In sum, TOL-F planning accuracy
   possesses adequate absolute and relative test-retest reliability for
   experimental utility. Future studies should assess whether this indeed
   translates into clinical utility of the TOL-F for measuring planning
   ability in patients.},

Title = {Spectral bandwidth of interictal fast epileptic activity characterizes
   the seizure onset zone},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {865-872},
Abstract = {The foremost aim of presurgical epilepsy evaluation is the delineation
   of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). There is increasing evidence that fast
   epileptic activity (FEA, 14-250 Hz) occurring interictally, i.e. between
   seizures, is predominantly localized within the SOZ. Currently it is
   unknown, which frequency band of FEA performs best in identifying the
   SOZ, although prior studies suggest highest concordance of spectral
   changes with the SOZ for high frequency changes. We suspected that FEA
   reflects dampened oscillations in local cortical excitatory-inhibitory
   neural networks, and that interictal FEA in the SOZ is a consequence of
   reduced oscillatory damping. We therefore predict a narrowing of the
   spectral bandwidth alongside increased amplitudes of spectral peaks
   during interictal FEA events. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated
   spectral changes during interictal FEA in invasive EEG (iEEG) recordings
   of 13 patients with focal epilepsy. In relative spectra of beta and
   gamma band changes (14-250 Hz) during FEA, we found that spectral peaks
   within the SOZ indeed were significantly more narrow-banded and their
   power changes were significantly higher than outside the SOZ. In
   contrast, the peak frequency did not differ within and outside the SOZ.
   Our results show that bandwidth and power changes of spectral
   modulations during FEA both help localizing the SOZ. We propose the
   spectral bandwidth as new source of information for the evaluation of
   EEG data.},

Abstract = {We report on the concept, development, and geometrical, optical as well

   optrode. This new device allows to optically interact with neuronal
   cells and simultaneously record their response with a high spatial
   resolution. Our design is based on a single-shank optical stimulation
   component and a multi-shank recording probe stacked together in a
   delicate assembly process. The electrical connection of both components
   is ensured by using flexible polyimide (PI) ribbon cables. The highly
   accurate relative positioning and precise alignment of the optical and
   electrical components in 3D with an optical output power at 460 nm well
   above 5 mW/mm(2) and an all-electrical interface makes this device a
   promising tool for optogenetic experiments in neuroscientific research.},

Title = {Ventral tegmental area dopaminergic lesion-induced depressive phenotype
   in the rat is reversed by deep brain stimulation of the medial forebrain
   bundle},

Volume = {299},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {DBS of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) has been investigated
   clinically in major depressive disorder patients with rapid and
   long-term reduction of symptoms. In the context of chronic bilateral
   high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the MFB, the current
   study looked at the impact of lesioning the ascending dopaminergic
   pathway at the level of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Sprague-Dawley
   female rats were given bilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the VTA
   (VTA-lx group) or were left unlesioned (control group). Later, all
   animals received bilateral microelectrode implantation into the MFB
   followed by chronic continuous stimulation for 3 weeks. Behavioral tests
   were performed as baseline and following MFB-DBS, along with
   histological analysis. Pre-stimulation baseline testing of the VTA-lx
   animals indicated depressive-like phenotype in comparison with controls.
   Response to MFB-DBS varied according to (i) the degree of dopaminergic
   depletion: animals with severe mesocorticolimbic dopamine depletion did
   not, whilst those with mild dopamine loss responded well to stimulation;
   (ii) environmental conditions and the nature of the behavioral tests,
   e.g., stressful vs non-stressful situations. Neuromodulation-induced
   c-fos expression in the prelimbic frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens
   was also dependent upon integrity of the dopaminergic ascending
   projections.
   Our results confirm a potential role for dopamine in symptom relief
   observed in clinical MFB-DBS. Although mechanisms are not fully
   understood, the data suggests that the rescue of depressive phenotype in
   rodents can work via both dopamine-dependent and independent mechanisms.
   Further investigations concerning the network of depression using
   neuromodulation platforms in animal models might give insight into
   genesis and treatment of major depression disorder. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {Subthalamic nucleus (STN) high-frequency stimulation (HFS) is a routine
   treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD), with confirmed long-term
   benefits. An alternative, but still experimental, treatment is cell
   replacement and restorative therapy based on transplanted dopaminergic
   neurons. The current experiment evaluated the potential synergy between
   neuromodulation and grafting by studying the effect of continuous
   STN-HFS on the survival, integration, and functional efficacy of ventral
   mesencephalic dopaminergic precursors transplanted into a unilateral
   6-hydroxydopamine medial forebrain bundle lesioned rodent PD model. One
   group received continuous HFS of the ipsilateral STN starting a week
   prior to intrastriatal dopaminergic neuron transplantation, whereas the
   sham-stimulated group did not receive STN-HFS but only dopaminergic
   grafts. A control group was neither lesioned nor transplanted. Over the
   following 7 weeks, the animals were probed on a series of behavioral
   tasks to evaluate possible graft and/or stimulation-induced functional
   effects. Behavioral and histological data suggest that STN-HFS
   significantly increased graft cell survival, graft-host integration, and
   functional recovery. These findings might open an unexplored road toward
   combining neuromodulative and neuroregenerative strategies to treat
   severe neurologic conditions.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, optical technologies have entered neural implant
   technologies. Applications such as optogenetics, near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS), and direct-near-infrared stimulation (NIS) request
   technical devices that combine electrical and optical recording as well
   as stimulation capabilities using light sources and/or optical sensors.
   Optoprobes are the technical devices that meet these requirements. This
   paper provides basic insights into optogenetic mechanisms, the
   background of NIRS and NIS, and focuses on fundamental requirements of
   technical systems from a biological background. The state of the art of
   optoprobes is reviewed and attention is drawn on the potential long-term
   stability of these technical devices for chronic neural implants.
   Further, material selection for stiff and flexible devices, applicable
   light sources, waveguide and coupling concepts, packaging paradigms as
   well as system assembly and integration aspects are discussed in view of
   biocompatible and biostable devices. This paper also considers the
   physical background of light scattering and heat generation when light
   sources are implanted into biological tissue.},

Abstract = {Human-centered environments are rich with a wide variety of spatial
   relations between everyday objects. For autonomous robots to operate
   effectively in such environments, they should be able to reason about
   these relations and generalize them to objects with different shapes and
   sizes. For example, having learned to place a toy inside a basket, a
   robot should be able to generalize this concept using a spoon and a cup.
   This requires a robot to have the flexibility to learn arbitrary
   relations in a lifelong manner, making it challenging for an expert to
   pre-program it with sufficient knowledge to do so beforehand. In this
   paper, we address the problem of learning spatial relations by
   introducing a novel method from the perspective of distance metric
   learning. Our approach enables a robot to reason about the similarity
   between pairwise spatial relations, thereby enabling it to use its
   previous knowledge when presented with a new relation to imitate. We
   show how this makes it possible to learn arbitrary spatial relations
   from non-expert users using a small number of examples and in an
   interactive manner. Our extensive evaluation with real-world data
   demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in reasoning about a
   continuous spectrum of spatial relations and generalizing them to new
   objects.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifacts resemble interictal
   epileptic discharges (IEDs) and can lead to incorrect IED identification
   in EEG-fMRI. This study investigates IEDs marked in EEGs corrected using
   information from a moire phase tracking (MPT) marker.
   Methods: EEG-fMRI from 18 patients was processed with conventional
   methods for BCG removal, while 9 patients used a MPT marker. IEDs were
   marked first without ECG information. In a second review, suspicious
   IEDs synchronous with the BCG were discarded. After each review, an
   event-related fMRI analysis was performed on the marked IEDs.
   Results: No difference was found in the proportion of suspicious IEDs in
   the 2 patient groups. However, the distribution of IED timings was
   significantly related to the cardiac cycle in 11 of 18 patients recorded
   without MPT marker, but only 2 of 9 patients with marker. In patients
   recorded without marker, failing to discard suspicious IEDs led to more
   inaccurate fMRI maps and more distant activations.
   Conclusions: BCG artifact correction based on MPT recordings allowed a
   more straightforward identification of IEDs that did not require ECG
   information in the large majority of patients.
   Significance: Marker-based ballistocardiographic artifact correction
   greatly facilitates the study of the generators of interictal discharges
   with EEG-fMRI. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical

Title = {An interpenetrating, microstructurable and covalently attached
   conducting polymer hydrogel for neural interfaces},
Journal = {ACTA BIOMATERIALIA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study presents a new conducting polymer hydrogel (CPH) system,
   consisting of the synthetic hydro gel P(DMAA-co-5\%MABP-co-2,5\%SSNa)
   and the conducting polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio phene)
   (PEDOT), intended as coating material for neural interfaces. The
   composite material can be covalently attached to the surface electrode,
   can be patterned by a photolithographic process to influence selected
   electrode sites only and forms an interpenetrating network. The hybrid
   material was characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV), impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which
   confirmed a homogeneous distribution of PEDOT throughout all CPH layers.
   The CPH exhibited a 2,5 times higher charge storage capacity (CSC) and a
   reduced impedance when compared to the bare hydrogel. Electrochemical
   stability was proven over at least 1000 redox cycles. Non-toxicity was
   confirmed using an elution toxicity test together with a neuroblastoma
   cell-line. The described material shows great promise for surface
   modification of neural probes making it possible to combine the
   beneficial properties of the hydrogel with the excellent electronic
   properties necessary for high quality neural microelectrodes.
   Statement of Significance
   Conductive polymer hydrogels have emerged as a promising new class of
   materials to functionalize electrode surfaces for enhanced neural
   interfaces and drug delivery. Common weaknesses of such systems are
   delamination from the connection surface, and the lack of suitable
   patterning methods for confining the gel to the selected electrode site.
   Various studies have reported on conductive polymer hydrogels addressing
   one of these challenges. In this study we present a new composite
   material which offers, for the first time, the unique combination of
   properties: it can be covalently attached to the substrate, forms an
   interpenetrating network, shows excellent electrical properties and can
   be patterned via UV-irradiation through a structured mask. (C) 2017 Acta

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Smiling, laughing, and overt speech production are fundamental to human
   everyday communication. However, little is known about how the human
   brain achieves the highly accurate and differentiated control of such
   orofacial movement during natural conditions. Here, we utilized the high
   spatiotemporal resolution of subdural recordings to elucidate how human
   motor cortex is functionally engaged during control of real-life
   orofacial motor behaviour. For each investigated movement class-lip
   licking, speech production, laughing and smiling-our findings reveal a
   characteristic brain activity pattern within the mouth motor cortex with
   both spatial segregation and overlap between classes. Our findings thus
   show that motor cortex relies on sparse and action-specific activation
   during real-life orofacial behaviour, apparently organized in distinct
   but overlapping subareas that control different types of natural
   orofacial movements.},

Title = {A Meta-analysis on the neural basis of planning: Activation likelihood
   estimation of functional brain imaging results in the Tower of London
   task},
Journal = {HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING},

Volume = {38},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The ability to mentally design and evaluate series of future actions has
   often been studied in terms of planning abilities, commonly using
   well-structured laboratory tasks like the Tower of London (ToL). Despite
   a wealth of studies, findings on the specific localization of planning
   processes within prefrontal cortex (PFC) and on the hemispheric
   lateralization are equivocal. Here, we address this issue by integrating
   evidence from two different sources of data: First, we provide a
   systematic overview of the existing lesion data on planning in the ToL
   (10 studies, 211 patients) which does not indicate any evidence for a
   general lateralization of planning processes in (pre)frontal cortex.
   Second, we report a quantitative meta-analysis with activation
   likelihood estimation based on 31 functional neuroimaging datasets on
   the ToL. Separate meta-analyses of the activation patterns reported for
   Overall Planning (537 participants) and for Planning Complexity (182
   participants) congruently show bilateral contributions of
   mid-dorsolateral PFC, frontal eye fields, supplementary motor area,
   precuneus, caudate, anterior insula, and inferior parietal cortex in
   addition to a left-lateralized involvement of rostrolateral PFC. In
   contrast to previous attributions of planning-related brain activity to
   the entire dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and either its left or
   right homolog derived from single studies on the ToL, the present
   meta-analyses stress the pivotal role specifically of the
   mid-dorsolateral part of PFC (mid-dlPFC), presumably corresponding to
   Brodmann Areas 46 and 9/46, and strongly argue for a bilateral rather
   than lateralized involvement of the dlPFC in planning in the ToL. Hum

Title = {Probing the reproducibility of quantitative estimates of structural
   connectivity derived from global tractography},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {175},
Pages = {215-229},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {As quantitative measures derived from fiber tractography are
   increasingly being used to characterize the structural connectivity of
   the brain, it is important to establish their reproducibility. However,
   no such information is as yet available for global tractography. Here we
   provide the first comprehensive analysis of the reproducibility of
   streamline counts derived from global tractography as quantitative
   estimates of structural connectivity. In a sample of healthy young
   adults scanned twice within one week, within-session and between-session
   test-retest reproducibility was estimated for streamline counts of
   connections based on regions of the AAL atlas using the intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) for absolute agreement. We further
   evaluated the influence of the type of head-coil (12 versus 32 channels)
   and the number of reconstruction repetitions (reconstructing streamlines
   once or aggregated over ten repetitions). Factorial analyses
   demonstrated that reproducibility was significantly greater for
   within-than between-session reproducibility and significantly increased
   by aggregating streamline counts over ten reconstruction repetitions.
   Using a high-resolution head-coil incurred only small beneficial
   effects. Overall, ICC values were positively correlated with the
   streamline count of a connection. Additional analyses assessed the
   influence of different selection variants (defining fuzzy versus no
   fuzzy borders of the seed mask; selecting streamlines that end in versus
   pass through a seed) showing that an endpoint-based variant using fuzzy
   selection provides the best compromise between reproducibility and
   anatomical specificity. In sum, aggregating quantitative indices over
   repeated estimations and higher numbers of streamlines are important
   determinants of test-retest reproducibility. If these factors are taken
   into account, streamline counts derived from global tractography provide
   an adequately reproducible quantitative measure that can be used to
   gauge the structural connectivity of the brain in health and disease.},

Title = {Influence of Augmented Visual Feedback on Balance Control in Unilateral
   Transfemoral Amputees},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Patients with a lower limb amputation rely more on visual feedback to
   maintain balance than able-bodied individuals. Altering this sensory
   modality in amputees thus results in a disrupted postural control.
   However, little is known about how lower limb amputees cope with
   augmented visual information during balance tasks. In this study, we
   investigated how unilateral transfemoral amputees incorporate visual
   feedback of their center of pressure (CoP) position during quiet
   standing. Ten transfemoral amputees and ten age-matched able-bodied
   participants were provided with real-time visual feedback of the
   position of their CoP while standing on a pressure platform. Their task
   was to keep their CoP within a small circle in the center of a computer
   screen placed at eye level, which could be achieved by minimizing their
   postural sway. The visual feedback was then delayed by 250 and 500 ms
   and was combined with a two- and five-fold amplification of the CoP
   displacements. Trials with eyes open without augmented visual feedback
   as well as with eyes closed were further performed. The overall
   performance was measured by computing the sway area. We further
   quantified the dynamics of the CoP adjustments using the entropic
   half-life (EnHL) to study possible physiological mechanisms behind
   postural control. Amputees showed an increased sway area compared to the
   control group. The EnHL values of the amputated leg were significantly
   higher than those of the intact leg and the dominant and non-dominant
   leg of controls. This indicates lower dynamics in the CoP adjustments of
   the amputated leg, which was compensated by increasing the dynamics of
   the CoP adjustments of the intact leg. Receiving real-time visual
   feedback of the CoP position did not significantly reduce the sway area
   neither in amputees nor in controls when comparing with the eyes open
   condition without visual feedback of the CoP position. Further, with
   increasing delay and amplification, both groups were able to compensate
   for small visual perturbations, yet their dynamics were significantly
   lower when additional information was not received in a physiologically
   relevant time frame. These findings may be used for future design of
   neurorehabilitation programs to restore sensory feedback in lower limb
   amputees.</p>},

Abstract = {State-of-the-art neural microprobes contain hundreds of electrodes
   within a single shaft. Due to hardware and wiring restrictions, it is
   usually only possible to measure a small subset of the available
   electrodes simultaneously. The selection of the best channels is
   typically performed offline either manually or automatically. However,
   having a fixed selection for long-term observation does not allow the
   system to react to changes in the neural activity, and may therefore
   lead to the loss of important information. In this paper, we formulate
   the process of autonomously selecting the best subset of electrodes as a
   combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem with non-stationary rewards,
   thus allowing the probe to adapt its selection policies online. In order
   to minimize exploratory actions of the probe, we furthermore take
   advantage of the existing dependencies between neighboring channels. Our
   approach is an adaptation of the discounted upper confidence bounds
   (D-UCB) algorithm, and identifies the electrodes providing the largest
   amount of non-redundant information. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first online approach for the problem of electrode selection. In
   extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our solution is not only able
   to converge towards an average optimal selection policy, but it is also
   able to react to changes in the neural activity or to damages of the
   recording electrodes.},

Abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) show very strong performance on many machine
   learning problems, but they are very sensitive to the setting of their
   hyperparameters. Automated hyperparameter optimization methods have
   recently been shown to yield settings competitive with those found by
   human experts, but their widespread adoption is hampered by the fact
   that they require more computational resources than human experts.
   Humans have one advantage: when they evaluate a poor hyperparameter
   setting they can quickly detect (after a few steps of stochastic
   gradient descent) that the resulting network performs poorly and
   terminate the corresponding evaluation to save time. In this paper, we
   mimic the early termination of bad runs using a probabilistic model that
   extrapolates the performance from the first part of a learning curve.
   Experiments with a broad range of neural network architectures on
   various prominent object recognition benchmarks show that our resulting
   approach speeds up state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization methods
   for DNNs roughly twofold, enabling them to find DNN settings that yield
   better performance than those chosen by human experts.},

Abstract = {Objectives: In simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), artifacts on the EEG arise from the
   switching of magnetic field gradients in the MR scanner. These artifacts
   depend on head position, and are, therefore, difficult to remove in the
   presence of subject motion. In this study, gradient artifacts are
   modeled by multiple templates extracted from externally recorded motion
   information. Methods: Gradient artifact correction was performed in
   EEG-fMRI recordings by estimating artifactual templates modulated by
   slowly varying splines, as well as head position information. The EEG
   signal quality was then compared following two common methods: averaged
   artifact subtraction (AAS) and optimal basis sets (OBS). Results:
   Artifact correction using multiple templates estimated from splines or
   motion time courses outperformed the existing AAS and OBS approaches, as
   quantified by root-meansquare power across gradient epochs. Improvements
   were mostly seen in posterior EEG channels, where most of the residual
   artifacts are seen following the AAS and OBS methods. Residual spectral
   power was comparable to that of EEG signals recorded without fMRI
   scanning. Conclusion: Gradient artifacts can be well modeled by multiple
   templates estimated from head position information, resulting in an
   effective artifact removal. Significance: This method can facilitate
   EEG-fMRI of uncooperative subjects in whom motion is inevitable, for
   example, to investigate high-frequency EEG activity in which gradient
   artifacts are particularly prominent.},

Abstract = {Costs and rewards are important tools for analysing quantitative aspects
   of models like energy consumption and costs of maintenance and repair.
   Under the assumption of transient costs, this paper considers the
   computation of expected cost-bounded rewards and cost-bounded
   reachability for Markov automata and Markov games. We provide a fixed
   point characterization of this class of properties under early
   schedulers. Additionally, we give a transformation to expected
   time-bounded rewards and time-bounded reachability, which can be
   computed by available algorithms. We prove the correctness of the
   transformation and show its effectiveness on a number of Markov automata
   case studies.},

Abstract = {Goal: To identify and overcome barriers to creating new
   neurotechnologies capable of restoring both motor and sensory function
   in individuals with neurological conditions. Methods: This report builds
   upon the outcomes of a joint workshop between the US National Science
   Foundation and the German Research Foundation on New Perspectives in
   Neuroengineering and Neurotechnology convened in Arlington, VA, USA,
   November 13-14, 2014. Results: The participants identified key
   technological challenges for recording and manipulating neural activity,
   decoding, and interpreting brain data in the presence of plasticity, and
   early considerations of ethical and social issues pertinent to the
   adoption of neurotechnologies. Conclusions: The envisaged progress in
   neuroengineering requires tightly integrated hardware and signal
   processing efforts, advances in understanding of physiological
   adaptations to closed-loop interactions with neural devices, and an open
   dialog with stakeholders and potential end-users of neurotechnology.
   Significance: The development of new neurotechnologies (e.g.,
   bidirectional brain-computer interfaces) could significantly improve the
   quality of life of people living with the effects of brain or spinal
   cord injury, or other neurodegenerative diseases. Focused efforts aimed
   at overcoming the remaining barriers at the electrode tissue interface,
   developing implantable hardware with on-board computation, and refining
   stimulation methods to precisely activate neural tissue will advance
   both our understanding of brain function and our ability to treat
   currently intractable disorders of the nervous system.},

   hydrodynamically designed interface between a porous MN array and
   microchannels to enable a direct analysis of liquids extracted by the
   porous MN array. The microfluidic chip with an interface for the MN
   array was successfully realized by standard MEMS processes, enabling a
   liquid flow through the whole microfluidic structure. The porous MN
   array was fabricated by the salt leaching and molding method, which was
   integrated with the chip and demonstrated the successful extraction of
   liquids from an agarose gel-based skin phantom.},

Title = {Distribution of Orientation Selectivity in Recurrent Networks of Spiking
   Neurons with Different Random Topologies},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex are more or less selective for the
   orientation of a light bar used for stimulation. A broad distribution of
   individual grades of orientation selectivity has in fact been reported
   in all species. A possible reason for emergence of broad distributions
   is the recurrent network within which the stimulus is being processed.
   Here we compute the distribution of orientation selectivity in randomly
   connected model networks that are equipped with different spatial
   patterns of connectivity. We show that, for a wide variety of
   connectivity patterns, a linear theory based on firing rates accurately
   approximates the outcome of direct numerical simulations of networks of
   spiking neurons. Distance dependent connectivity in networks with a more
   biologically realistic structure does not compromise our linear
   analysis, as long as the linearized dynamics, and hence the uniform
   asynchronous irregular activity state, remain stable. We conclude that
   linear mechanisms of stimulus processing are indeed responsible for the
   emergence of orientation selectivity and its distribution in recurrent
   networks with functionally heterogeneous synaptic connectivity.},

Title = {Transcranial direct current stimulation over left and right DLPFC:
   Lateralized effects on planning performance and related eye movements},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {130-140},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (d1PFC) were recently
   found to be differentially affected by unilateral continuous theta-burst
   stimulation, reflected in an oppositional alteration of initial thinking
   time (ITT) in the Tower of London planning task.
   Here, we further explored this finding using bilateral transcranial
   direct current stimulation (tDCS) and simultaneous tracking of eye
   movements. Results revealed a decrease in ITT during concurrent cathodal
   tDCS of left dIPFC and anodal tDCS of right dIPFC. Eye-movement analyses
   showed that this facilitating tDCS effect was associated with the actual
   planning phase, thus reflecting a planning-specific impact of
   stimulation. For the reverse stimulation pattern of cathodal tDCS of
   right dIPFC and anodal tDCS of left dIPFC, an increase in gaze shifts
   was observed, without a significant impact on ITT.
   Taken together, these findings corroborate that enhanced planning
   performance can be obtained by boosting right dIPFC and dismantling the
   inhibitory impact of left dIPFC. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Neurological disorders are increasingly analysed and treated with
   implantable electrodes, and patients with such electrodes are studied
   with MRI despite the risk of radio-frequency (RF) induced heating during
   the MRI exam. Recent clinical research suggests that electrodes with
   smaller diameters of the electrical interface between implant and tissue
   are beneficial; however, the influence of this electrode contact
   diameter on RF-induced heating has not been investigated. In this work,
   electrode contact diameters between 0.3 and 4 mm of implantable
   electrodes appropriate for stimulation and electrocorticography were
   evaluated in a 1.5 T MRI system. In situ temperature measurements
   adapted from the ASTM standard test method were performed and
   complemented by simulations of the specific absorption rate (SAR) to
   assess local SAR values, temperature increase and the distribution of
   dissipated power. Measurements showed temperature changes between 0.8 K
   and 53 K for different electrode contact diameters, which is well above
   the legal limit of 1 K. Systematic errors in the temperature
   measurements are to be expected, as the temperature sensors may disturb
   the heating pattern near small electrodes. Compared to large electrodes,
   simulations suggest that small electrodes are subject to less dissipated
   power, but more localized power density. Thus, smaller electrodes might
   be classified as safe in current certification procedures but may be
   more likely to burn adjacent tissue. To assess these local heating
   phenomena, smaller temperature sensors or new non-invasive temperature
   sensing methods are needed.},

Abstract = {Objective The applicability of the balanced steady-state free precession
   (bSSFP) sequence to the field of MR microscopy was investigated, since
   the potentially high SNR makes bSSFP attractive. However, particularly
   at ultra-high magnetic fields, a number of constraints emerge: the
   frequency sensitivity of the bSSFP signal, the duty cycle of the imaging
   gradients, and the intrinsic diffusion attenuation of the steady state
   due to the imaging gradients.
   Materials and methods Optimization of the bSSFP sequence was performed
   on three imaging systems (7T and 9.4T) suited for MR microscopy. Since
   biological samples are often imaged in the very proximity of materials
   from sample containers/holder or devices such as electrodes, several
   microscopy phantoms representing such circumstances were fabricated and
   examined with 3D bSSFP.
   Results Artifact-free microscopic bSSFP images could be obtained with
   voxel sizes down to 16 mu m x 16 mu m x 78 mu m and with an SNR gain of
   25\% over standard gradient echo images.
   Conclusion With appropriate choice of phantom materials, optimization of
   the flip angle to the diffusion-attenuated steady state and protocols
   considering duty-cycle limitations, bSSFP can be a valuable tool in MR
   microscopy.},

Title = {Pre-Trial EEG-Based Single-Trial Motor Performance Prediction to Enhance
   Neuroergonomics for a Hand Force Task},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {We propose a framework for building electrophysiological predictors of
   single-trial motor performance variations, exemplified for SVIPT, a
   sequential isometric force control task suitable for hand motor
   rehabilitation after stroke. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 20
   subjects with mean age of 53 years was recorded prior to and during 400
   trials of SVIPT. They were executed within a single session with the
   non-dominant left hand, while receiving continuous visual feedback of
   the produced force trajectories. The behavioral data showed strong
   trial-by-trial performance variations for five clinically relevant
   metrics, which accounted for reaction time as well as for the smoothness
   and precision of the produced force trajectory. 18 out of 20 tested
   subjects remained after preprocessing and entered offline analysis.
   Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) was applied on EEG data of a short time
   interval prior to the start of each SVIPT trial. For 11 subjects, SPoC
   revealed robust oscillatory EEG subspace components, whose bandpower
   activity are predictive for the performance of the upcoming trial. Since
   SPoC may overfit to non-informative subspaces, we propose to apply three
   selection criteria accounting for the meaningfulness of the features.
   Across all subjects, the obtained components were spread along the
   frequency spectrum and showed a variety of spatial activity patterns.
   Those containing the highest level of predictive information resided in
   and close to the alpha band. Their spatial patterns resemble topologies
   reported for visual attention processes as well as those of imagined or
   executed hand motor tasks. In summary, we identified subject-specific
   single predictors that explain up to 36\% of the performance
   fluctuations and may serve for enhancing neuroergonomics of motor
   rehabilitation scenarios.},

Abstract = {Extracellular, large scale in vivo recording of neural activity is
   mandatory for elucidating the interaction of neurons within large neural
   networks at the level of their single unit activity. Technological
   achievements in MEMS-based multichannel electrode arrays offer
   electrophysiological recording capabilities that go far beyond those of
   classical wire electrodes. Despite their impressive channel counts,
   recording systems with modest interconnection overhead have been
   demonstrated thanks to the hybrid integration of CMOS circuitry for
   signal preprocessing and data handling. The number of addressable
   channels is increased even further by a switch matrix for electrode
   selection co-integrated along the slender probe shafts. When realized by
   IC fabrication technologies, these probes offer highest recording site
   densities along the entire shaft length.},

Title = {Are semantic and phonological fluency based on the same or distinct sets
   of cognitive processes? Insights from factor analyses in healthy adults
   and stroke patients},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {148-155},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Verbal fluency for semantic categories and phonological letters is
   frequently applied to studies of language and executive functions.
   Despite its popularity, it is still debated whether measures of semantic
   and phonological fluency reflect the same or distinct sets of cognitive
   processes. Word generation in the two task variants is believed to
   involve different types of search processes. Findings from the lesion
   and neuroimaging literature further suggest a stronger reliance of
   phonological and semantic fluency on frontal and temporal brain areas,
   respectively. This evidence for differential cognitive and neural
   contributions is, however, strongly challenged by findings from factor
   analyses, which have consistently yielded only one explanatory factor.
   As all previous factor-analytical approaches were based on very small
   item sets, this apparent discrepancy may be due to methodological
   limitations. In this study, we therefore applied a German version of the
   verbal fluency task with 8 semantic (i.e. categories) and 8 phonological
   items (i.e. letters). An exploratory factor analysis with oblique
   rotation in N=69 healthy young adults indeed revealed a two-factor
   solution with markedly different loadings for semantic and phonological
   items. This pattern was corroborated by a confirmatory factor analysis
   in a sample of N=174 stroke patients. As results from both samples also
   revealed a substantial portion of common variance between the semantic
   and phonological factor, the present data further demonstrate that
   semantic and phonological verbal fluency are based on clearly distinct
   but also on shared sets of cognitive processes.},

Title = {Distinct white matter alterations following severe stroke Longitudinal
   DTI study in neglect},
Journal = {NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {88},
Number = {16},
Pages = {1546-1555},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Objective: To distinguish white matter remodeling directly induced by
   stroke lesion from that evoked by remote network dysfunction, using
   spatial neglect as a model.
   Methods: We examined 24 visual neglect/extinction patients and 17
   control patients combining comprehensive analyses of diffusion tensor
   metrics and global fiber tracking with neuropsychological testing in the
   acute (6.3 +/- 0.5 days poststroke) and chronic (134 +/- 7 days
   poststroke) stroke phases.
   Results: Compared to stroke controls, patients with spatial
   neglect/extinction displayed longitudinal white matter alterations with
   2 defining signatures: (1) perilesional degenerative changes
   characterized by congruently reduced fractional anisotropy and increased
   radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity, all
   suggestive of direct axonal damage by lesion and therefore nonspecific
   for impaired attention network and (2) transneuronal changes
   characterized by an increased RD in contralesional frontoparietal and
   bilateral occipital connections, suggestive of primary periaxonal
   involvement; these changes were distinctly related to the degree of
   unrecovered neglect symptoms in chronic stroke, hence emerging as
   network-specific alterations.
   Conclusions: The present data show how stroke entails global alterations
   of lesion-spared network architecture over time. Sufficiently large
   lesions of widely interconnected association cortex induce distinct,
   large-scale structural reorganization in domain-specific network
   connections. Besides their relevance to unrecovered domain-specific
   symptoms, these effects might also explain mechanisms of domain-general
   deficits in stroke patients, pointing to potential targets for
   therapeutic intervention.},

Journal = {NATURE PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Implantable neural interfaces advance the possibilities for
   neuroscientists to study the brain. They are also promising for use in a
   multitude of bioelectronic therapies. Electrode technology plays a
   central role in these developments, as the electrode surfaces form the
   physical interfaces between technology and the biological targets.
   Despite this, a common understanding of how electrodes should best be
   evaluated and compared with respect to their efficiency in recording and
   stimulation is currently lacking. Without broadly accepted performance
   tests, it is difficult to rank the many suggestions for electrode
   materials available in the literature, or to identify where efforts
   should be focused to advance the field most efficiently. This tutorial
   critically discusses the most relevant performance tests for
   characterization of neural interface electrodes and explains their
   implementation, interpretation and respective limitations. We propose a
   unified standard to facilitate transparent reporting on electrode
   performance, promote efficient scientific process and ultimately
   accelerate translation into clinical practice.
   This tutorial describes a set of essential performance tests for
   characterization of neural interface electrodes. The authors provide
   guidelines for standardized implementation and reporting on electrode
   performances.},

   communication between neurons in the brain can be seen as examples of
   networks with complex dynamics. The properties of such dynamics depend
   largely on the topology of the underlying network graph. In this work,
   we want to answer the following question: Knowing network connectivity,
   what can be said about the level of third-order correlations that will
   characterize the network dynamics? We consider a linear point process as
   a model for pulse-coded, or spiking activity in a neuronal network.
   Using recent results from theory of such processes, we study third-order
   correlations between spike trains in such a system and explain which
   features of the network graph (i.e. which topological motifs) are
   responsible for their emergence. Comparing two different models of
   network topology-random networks of Erdos-Renyi type and networks with
   highly interconnected hubs-we find that, in random networks, the average
   measure of third-order correlations does not depend on the local
   connectivity properties, but rather on global parameters, such as the
   connection probability. This, however, ceases to be the case in networks
   with a geometric out-degree distribution, where topological
   specificities have a strong impact on average correlations.},

Title = {A Markov model for the temporal dynamics of balanced random networks of
   finite size},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {The balanced state of recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory
   spiking neurons is characterized by fluctuations of population activity
   about an attractive fixed point. Numerical simulations show that these
   dynamics are essentially nonlinear, and the intrinsic noise
   (self-generated fluctuations) in networks of finite size is
   state-dependent. Therefore, stochastic differential equations with
   additive noise of fixed amplitude cannot provide an adequate description
   of the stochastic dynamics. The noise model should, rather, result from
   a self-consistent description of the network dynamics. Here, we consider
   a two-state Markovian neuron model, where spikes correspond to
   transitions from the active state to the refractory state. Excitatory
   and inhibitory input to this neuron affects the transition rates between
   the two states. The corresponding nonlinear dependencies can be
   identified directly from numerical simulations of networks of leaky
   integrate-and-fire neurons, discretized at a time resolution in the
   sub-millisecond range. Deterministic mean-field equations, and a noise
   component that depends on the dynamic state of the network, are obtained
   from this model. The resulting stochastic model reflects the behavior
   observed in numerical simulations quite well, irrespective of the size
   of the network. In particular, a strong temporal correlation between the
   two populations, a hallmark of the balanced state in random recurrent
   networks, are well represented by our model. Numerical simulations of
   such networks show that a log-normal distribution of short-term spike
   counts is a property of balanced random networks with fixed in-degree
   that has not been considered before, and our model shares this
   statistical property. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the flow from
   simulated time series suggests that the mean-field dynamics of
   finite-size networks are essentially of Wilson-Cowan type. We expect
   that this novel nonlinear stochastic model of the interaction between
   neuronal populations also opens new doors to analyze the joint dynamics
   of multiple interacting networks.},

Abstract = {The development of the branch-stem-attachment of Dracaena marginata was
   analyzed to clarify how a load-adapted arrangement of mechanically

   within the time span of 180 days using high-resolution magnetic
   resonance imaging, as this method allows for non-invasive and
   non-destructive image acquisition. This methodical approach enabled the
   classification of distinct ontogenetic stages revealing the complex
   ontogeny of the branch-stem-attachment in D. marginata and the
   establishment of a load-adapted tissue arrangement within the junction
   between branch and main stem. This further allows for a first biomimetic
   abstraction and the transfer into a technical implementation of the

Abstract = {Cortical information processing at the cellular level has predominantly
   been studied in local networks, which are dominated by strong vertical
   connectivity between layers. However, recent studies suggest that the
   bulk of axons targeting pyramidal neurons most likely originate from
   outside this local range, emphasizing the importance of horizontal
   connections. We mapped a subset of these connections to L5B pyramidal
   neurons in rat somatosensory cortex with photostimulation, identifying
   intact projections up to a lateral distance of 2 mm. Our estimates of
   the spatial distribution of cells presynaptic to L5B pyramids support
   the idea that the majority is located outside the local volume. The
   synaptic physiology of horizontal connections does not differ markedly
   from that of local connections, whereas the layer and
   cell-type-dependent pattern of innervation does. Apart from L2/3, L6A
   provides a strong source of horizontal connections. Implementing our
   data into a spiking neuronal network model shows that more horizontal
   connections promote robust asynchronous ongoing activity states and
   reduce noise correlations in stimulus-induced activity.},

Title = {Direct modelling of gradient artifacts for EEG-fMRI denoising and motion
   tracking},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective. Simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging recording (EEG-fMRI) has been widely used in
   neuroscientific and clinical research. The artifacts in the recorded EEG
   resulting from rapidly switching magnetic field gradients are usually
   corrected by average-artifact subtraction (AAS) due to their repetitive
   nature. But the performance of AAS is often disrupted by altered
   artifact waveforms across epochs, notably due to head motion. Approach.
   Here, a method is proposed to make use of the known MR sequence gradient
   waveforms for a direct modelling of gradient artifacts. After accounting
   for filtering effects on the gradient artifacts, a continuous modulation
   of the gradient waveforms superimposed on the EEG signal is obtained.
   Main results. Although a moving AAS template can adjust to slow drifts
   in gradient artifact variation, it fails to adapt to abrupt motion,
   resulting in residual noise. We demonstrate how this modelling approach
   can reduce motion-affected gradient artifacts without distorting the
   underlying neuronal signals. Moreover, the method provides useful head
   motion information highly correlated with motion tracked by an optical
   camera. Significance. Our work provides a novel way to improve gradient
   artifact removal in EEG-fMRI, and shows a potential to detect head
   motion without requiring additional hardware.},

Title = {Dissociating frontal and temporal correlates of phonological and
   semantic fluency in a large sample of left hemisphere stroke patients},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},
Abstract = {Previous lesion studies suggest that semantic and phonological fluency
   are differentially subserved by distinct brain regions in the left
   temporal and the left frontal cortex, respectively. However, as of yet,
   this often implied double dissociation has not been explicitly
   investigated due to mainly two reasons: (i) the lack of sufficiently
   large samples of brain-lesioned patients that underwent assessment of
   the two fluency variants and (ii) the lack of tools to assess
   interactions in factorial analyses of non-normally distributed
   behavioral data. In addition, previous studies did not control for task
   resource artifacts potentially introduced by the generally higher task
   difficulty of phonological compared to semantic fluency.
   We addressed these issues by task-difficulty adjusted assessment of
   semantic and phonological fluency in 85 chronic patients with ischemic
   stroke of the left middle cerebral artery. For classical region-based
   lesion-behavior mapping patients were grouped with respect to their
   primary lesion location. Building on the extension of the non-parametric
   Brunner-Munzel rank-order test to multi-factorial designs, ANOVA-type
   analyses revealed a significant two-way interaction for cue type
   (semantic vs. phonological) by lesion location (left temporal vs. left
   frontal vs. other as stroke control group). Subsequent contrast analyses
   further confirmed the proposed double dissociation by demonstrating that
   (i) compared to stroke controls, left temporal lesions led to
   significant impairments in semantic but not in phonological fluency,
   whereas left frontal lesions led to significant impairments in
   phonological but not in semantic fluency, and that (ii) patients with
   frontal lesions showed significantly poorer performance in phonological
   than in semantic fluency, whereas patients with temporal lesions showed
   significantly poorer performance in semantic than in phonological
   fluency.
   The anatomical specificity of these findings was further assessed in
   voxel-based lesion-behavior mapping analyses using the multi-factorial
   extension of the Brunner-Munzel test. Voxel-wise ANOVA-type analyses
   identified circumscribed parts of left inferior frontal gyrus and left
   superior and middle temporal gyrus that significantly double-dissociated
   with respect to their differential contribution to phonological and
   semantic fluency, respectively. Furthermore, a main effect of lesion
   with significant impairments in both fluency types was found in left
   inferior frontal regions adjacent to but not overlapping with those
   showing the differential effect for phonological fluency.
   The present study hence not only provides first explicit evidence for
   the anatomical double dissociation in verbal fluency at the group level
   but also clearly underlines that its formulation constitutes an
   oversimplification as parts of left frontal cortex appear to contribute
   to both semantic and phonological fluency.},

Title = {A 22 V Compliant 56 mu W Twin-Track Active Charge Balancing Enabling
   100\% Charge Compensation Even in Monophasic and 36\% Amplitude
   Correction in Biphasic Neural Stimulators},

Abstract = {Closed-loop charge balancers make a considerable contribution to a safe
   and secure electrical stimulation and additionally present an
   alternative to bulky blocking capacitors. This CMOS-integrated, 22 V
   compliant Twin-Track active charge balancer accomplishes both
   instantaneous and long-term balanced conditions. Long-term charge
   balancing is achieved by a cause-based PI-controlled offset compensation
   of the remaining electrode voltage. A Gm of only 1.5 nS offers a large
   (8 ms) time constant with only a 12 pF capacitor and leads to the first
   integrated PI-controller for offset compensation in neural implants.
   Instantaneous autonomous balancing is realized by a second concept, the
   consequence-based Inter-Pulse Charge Control. It uses a class-B
   architecture to supply the compensation currents. Thus, no additional
   references are required to define the safety window of the remaining
   electrode voltage. It consumes 31.8 mu W in the idle state, while the
   delivered output power can be as high as 11 mW. The two complementary
   approaches can be combined to one system, providing the opportunity to
   achieve a better performance. The system consumes 56 mu W and features a
   36\% mismatch correction in biphasic stimuli amplitude, as well as an
   autonomous 100\% charge removal at maximum compensation amplitudes of
   500 mu A, which makes it a suitable complement to monophasic
   stimulators.},

Abstract = {Markov automata are a powerful formalism for modelling systems which
   exhibit nondeterminism, probabilistic choices and continuous stochastic
   timing. We consider the computation of long-run average rewards, the
   most classical problem in continuous-time Markov model analysis. We
   propose an algorithm based on value iteration. It improves the state of
   the art by orders of magnitude. The contribution is rooted in a fresh
   look on Markov automata, namely by treating them as an efficient
   encoding of CTMDPs with - in the worst case - exponentially more
   transitions.},

   an inner diameter of 1.5 mm, an interwinding pitch of 100 mu m and five
   or eight coil windings respectively. The coils were designed for
   application in magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, and
   characterised in a 9.4 T MR scanner. An NMR spectrum of water and MR
   images in receive only and transceive mode were acquired as proof of

Title = {Dissociation among preserved resistance to proactive interference and
   impaired behavioral inhibition in a patient with bilateral lesions in
   the inferior frontal gyrus: A single-case study},
Journal = {CORTEX},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {111-127},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Inhibition is not a unitary construct, as different inhibition-related
   functions have been disentangled. The present single-case study compares
   performance of a patient with bilateral lesions in the inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG) and anterior insula to healthy age-matched controls in
   different inhibition-related tasks. Particular focus was on the
   resolution of proactive interference that is supposed to rely on
   bilateral IFG and anterior insula.
   Two working memory tasks previously proven sensitive to deficits in
   proactive interference (recent-probes, n-back) and two tasks measuring
   behavioral inhibition (verb generation task, Stroop task) were
   administered. Against expectations, the patient did not show any
   deficits in measures of proactive interference. However, compared to
   controls, she demonstrated considerably reduced performance in both
   measures of behavioral inhibition, thus resulting in a classical
   dissociation between proactive interference and behavioral inhibition.
   Although performance improved during the chronic phase post stroke, the
   overall pattern of a classical dissociation between proactive
   interference and behavioral inhibition remained stable across time.
   Taken together, the present data support the role of the IFG in
   inhibition-related functions, but a direct relationship between lesions
   in the IFG and difficulties in resolution of proactive interference
   could not be corroborated. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Revisiting the Functional Specialization of Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus
   in Phonological and Semantic Fluency: The Crucial Role of Task Demands
   and Individual Ability},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Despite a large body of research, extant findings on the functional role
   of left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in phonological and semantic
   fluency are still controversial. Based on cross-study comparisons, a
   recent meta-analysis of neuroimaging results suggests that
   posterior-dorsal (Brodmann area, BA, 44) and anterior-ventral parts (BA
   45) of LIFG contribute differentially to processes of phonologically and
   semantically cued word retrieval, respectively. In contrast, a
   subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment failed to
   validate the proposed dissociation using a within-subjects design. In
   particular, no evidence for a specific role of BA 45 in semantic fluency
   was found. Here, we resolve this apparent controversy by showing that
   the conflicting findings can be accounted for when considering the
   influence of task demands and individual ability on resulting functional
   magnetic resonance imaging activation patterns. By comparing
   phonological versus semantic fluency, higher activation was robustly
   observed in BA 44. For the opposite comparison, higher activation was
   found in dorsal BA 45; however, this was more pronounced in
   posterior-dorsal parts of BA 45 for low-performing subjects and was only
   apparent in anterior-dorsal parts of BA 45 under high demands on
   controlled semantic retrieval. Our results thus disclose important
   determinants for detecting a functional segregation of LIFG in verbal
   fluency that also have implications for the controversial findings in
   previous lesion studies. Moreover, the present parcellation of dorsal BA
   45 corresponds well with anatomical evidence suggesting a subdivision
   into an anterior (45A) and posterior part (45B) and may therefore
   represent evidence for its functional significance in humans.},

Abstract = {Bioelectronic devices, interfacing neural tissue for therapeutic,
   diagnostic, or rehabilitation purposes, rely on small electrode contacts
   in order to achieve highly sophisticated communication at the neural
   interface. Reliable recording and safe stimulation with small
   electrodes, however, are limited when conventional electrode
   metallizations are used, demanding the development of new materials to
   enable future progress within bioelectronics. In this study, we present
   a versatile process for the realization of nanostructured platinum
   (nanoPt) coatings with a high electrochemically active surface area,
   showing promising biocompatibility and providing low impedance, high
   charge injection capacity, and outstanding long-term stability both for
   recording and stimulation. The proposed electrochemical fabrication
   process offers exceptional control over the nanoPt deposition, allowing
   the realization of specific coating morphologies such as small grains,
   pyramids, or nanoflakes, and can moreover be scaled up to wafer level or
   batch fabrication under economic process conditions. The suitability of
   nanoPt as a coating for neural interfaces is here demonstrated, in vitro
   and in vivo, revealing superior stimulation performance under chronic
   conditions. Thus, nanoPt offers promising qualities as an advanced
   neural interface coating which moreover extends to the numerous
   application fields where a large (electro)chemically active surface area
   contributes to increased efficiency.},

Title = {Orientation Selectivity in Inhibition-Dominated Networks of Spiking
   Neurons: Effect of Single Neuron Properties and Network Dynamics},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The neuronal mechanisms underlying the emergence of orientation
   selectivity in the primary visual cortex of mammals are still elusive.
   In rodents, visual neurons show highly selective responses to oriented
   stimuli, but neighboring neurons do not necessarily have similar
   preferences. Instead of a smooth map, one observes a salt-and-pepper
   organization of orientation selectivity. Modeling studies have recently
   confirmed that balanced random networks are indeed capable of amplifying
   weakly tuned inputs and generating highly selective output responses,
   even in absence of feature-selective recurrent connectivity. Here we
   seek to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon by
   resorting to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, which are amenable
   to analytic treatment. Specifically, in networks of perfect
   integrate-and-fire neurons, we observe that highly selective and
   contrast invariant output responses emerge, very similar to networks of
   leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We then demonstrate that a theory
   based on mean firing rates and the detailed network topology predicts
   the output responses, and explains the mechanisms underlying the
   suppression of the common-mode, amplification of modulation, and
   contrast invariance. Increasing inhibition dominance in our networks
   makes the rectifying nonlinearity more prominent, which in turn adds
   some distortions to the otherwise essentially linear prediction. An
   extension of the linear theory can account for all the distortions,
   enabling us to compute the exact shape of every individual tuning curve
   in our networks. We show that this simple form of nonlinearity adds two
   important properties to orientation selectivity in the network, namely
   sharpening of tuning curves and extra suppression of the modulation. The
   theory can be further extended to account for the nonlinearity of the
   leaky model by replacing the rectifier by the appropriate smooth
   input-output transfer function. These results are robust and do not
   depend on the state of network dynamics, and hold equally well for
   mean-driven and fluctuation-driven regimes of activity.},

   severely motor restricted end-users},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Objective: Connect-Four, a new sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) based
   brain-computer interface (BCI) gaming application, was evaluated by four
   severely motor restricted end-users; two were in the locked-in state and
   had unreliable eye-movement.
   Methods: Following the user-centred approach, usability of the BCI
   prototype was evaluated in terms of effectiveness (accuracy), efficiency
   (information transfer rate (ITR) and subjective workload) and users'
   satisfaction.
   Results: Online performance varied strongly across users and sessions
   (median accuracy (\%) of end-users: A=.65; B=.60; C=.47; D=.77). Our
   results thus yielded low to `Medium effectiveness in three end-users and
   high effectiveness in one end-user. Consequently, ITR was low (0.05-1.44
   bits/min). Only two end-users were able to play the game in free-mode.
   Total workload was moderate but varied strongly across sessions. Main
   sources of workload were mental and temporal demand. Furthermore,
   frustration contributed to the subjective workload of two end-users.
   Nevertheless, most end-users accepted the BCI application well and rated
   satisfaction medium to high. Sources for dissatisfaction were (1)
   electrode gel and cap, (2) low effectiveness, (3) time-consuming
   adjustment and (4) not easy-to-use BCI equipment. All four end-users
   indicated ease of use as being one of the most important aspect of BCI.
   Conclusion: Effectiveness and efficiency are lower as compared to
   applications using the event-related potential as input channel.
   Nevertheless, the SMR-BCI application was satisfactorily accepted by the
   end-users and two of four could imagine using the BCI application in
   their daily life. Thus, despite moderate effectiveness and efficiency
   BCIs might be an option when controlling an application for

Title = {An optoelectronic neural interface approach for precise superposition of
   optical and electrical stimulation in flexible array structures},
Journal = {BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {205},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Optical stimulation of genetically modified nerve cells has become one
   of the state-of-the-art methods in neuroscience. This so-called
   optogenetic approach allows cell-type specific activation in comparison
   to more generalized electrical stimulation. Combinations of both
   stimulation modalities would be desirable to investigate effects in
   detail and specify differences. This work presents the design of a
   miniaturized optoelectronic device that allows optical and electrical
   activation at the same spot. Indium tin oxide (ITO), which is
   transparent to visible light, has been chosen as electrode material.
   Light emitting diodes were assembled on a polyimide substrate with
   integrated interconnection lines, directly behind the electrodes to
   compare optical with electrical stimulation. The optical transparency of
   the ITO-polyimide layer stack was investigated and showed sufficient
   transmission in the required wavelength range. ITO electrodes with
   diameters up to 1000 mu m were electrochemically characterized using
   electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Several diameters did show
   comparable results to platinum, a commonly used electrode material.
   Fully assembled devices were used in combination an ex vivo setting with
   genetically modified retina to demonstrate the functionality of this
   approach. Retinal ganglion cells were excited by both, optical and
   electrical stimulation at the same spot and signals were recorded via
   standard microelectrode arrays (MEA) as reference. The simultaneous
   stimulation and recording of directly evoked action potentials indicates
   a similar mode of action of the two stimulation modalities. Further
   engineering work is needed to transfer the presented and proven concept
   into devices for chronic implantation, might it be in animal or
   first-in-human studies.},

Journal = {ADVANCED BIOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Future-oriented directions in neural interface technologies point
   towards the development of multimodal devices that combine different
   functionalities such as neural stimulation, neurotransmitter sensing,
   and drug release within one platform. Conducting polymer hydrogels
   (CPHs) are suggested as materials for the coating of standard metal
   electrodes to add functionalities such as local delivery of therapeutic
   drugs. However, to make such coatings truly useful for multimodal
   devices, it is necessary to develop process technologies that allow the
   micropatterning of CPHs onto selected electrode sites. In this study, a
   wafer-scale fabrication procedure is presented, which is used to coat
   the CPH, based on the hydrogel P(DMAA-co-5\%MABP-co-2,5\%SSNa) and the
   conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), onto
   flexible neural probes. The resulting material has favorable properties
   for the generation of recording electrodes and in addition offers a
   convenient platform for biofunctionalization. By controlling the PEDOT
   content within the hydrogel matrix, charge injection limits of up to 3.7
   mC cm(-2) are obtained. Long-term stability is tested by immersing
   coated samples in phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37 degrees C for
   1 year. Non-cytotoxicity of the coatings is confirmed with a direct cell
   culture test using a fluorescent neuroblastoma cell line.},

Title = {Nanostructured platinum grass enables superior impedance reduction for
   neural microelectrodes},
Journal = {BIOMATERIALS},

Volume = {67},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Micro-sized electrodes are essential for highly sensitive communication
   at the neural interface with superior spatial resolution. However, such
   small electrodes inevitably suffer from high electrical impedance and
   thus high levels of thermal noise deteriorating the signal to noise
   ratio. In order to overcome this problem, a nanostructured Pt-coating
   was introduced as add-on functionalization for impedance reduction of
   small electrodes. In comparison to platinum black deposition, all used
   chemicals in the deposition process are free from cytotoxic components.
   The grass-like nanostructure was found to reduce the impedance by almost
   two orders of magnitude compared to untreated samples which was lower
   than what could be achieved with conventional electrode coatings like
   IrOx or PEDOT. The realization of the Pt-grass coating is performed via
   a simple electrochemical process which can be applied to virtually any
   possible electrode type and accordingly shows potential as a universal
   impedance reduction strategy. Elution tests revealed non-toxicity of the
   Pt-grass and the coating was found to exhibit strong adhesion to the
   metallized substrate. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the proof of concept a very fast adaptive
   glass membrane lens with a large aperture/diameter ratio, spherical
   aberration correction and integrated actuation. The membrane is directly
   deformed using two piezo actuators that can tune the focal length and
   the conical parameter. This operating principle allows for a usable
   aperture of the whole membrane diameter. Together with the efficient
   actuation mechanism, the aperture is around 2/3 of the total system
   diameter - at a thickness of less than 2mm. The response time is a few
   milliseconds at 12mm aperture, which is fast compared to similar
   systems.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the fabrication, assembly, characterization and
   validation of a novel opto-electrical cardiac stimulator designed to
   augment a mechanical pacing device. The integration of miniaturized
   electrodes and blue light-emitting diode (LED) chips on the pacer tip
   with a diameter of 1 mm enables the application of multimodal stimuli in
   one location on the surface of isolated murine hearts. The
   opto-electrical stimulator is based on two separate polyimide (PI)
   substrates each with a thickness of 10 mu m combined into a functional
   unit based on dedicated assembly and encapsulation processes using
   silicone rubber. The experimental validation in isolated, whole hearts
   compares electrical, optical and mechanical stimuli exerted at
   frequencies of up to 8 Hz on Langen-dorff-perfused hearts expressing
   channelrhodopsin-2. The integrated iridium oxide electrodes implemented
   above the LED chips enable simultaneous electrical recordings of local
   cardiac electrical activity.},

Title = {Improving the sensitivity of spin-echo fMRI at 3T by highly accelerated
   acquisitions},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},

Pages = {245-257},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Purpose: Spin-echo (SE) functional MRI (fMRI) can be highly advantageous
   compared to gradient-echo (GE) fMRI with respect to magnetic
   field-inhomogeneity artifacts. However, at 3T, the majority of blood
   oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI experiments are performed using
   T{*}(2) -weighted GE sequences because of their superior sensitivity
   compared to SE-fMRI. The presented SE implementation of a highly
   accelerated GE pulse sequence therefore aims to improve the sensitivity
   of SE-fMRI while profiting from a reduction of susceptibility-induced
   signal dropout.
   Methods: Spin-echo MR encephalography (SE-MREG) is compared with the
   more conventionally used spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) and
   spin-echo simultaneous multislice (SE-SMS) at 3T in terms of capability
   to detect neuronal activations and resting-state functional
   connectivity. For activation analysis, healthy subjects underwent
   consecutive SE-MREG (pulse repetition time {[}TR] = 0.25 seconds),
   SE-SMS (TR = 1.3 seconds), and SE-EPI (TR = 4.4 seconds) scans in
   pseudorandomized order applied to a visual block design paradigm for
   generation of t-statistics maps. For the investigation of functional
   connectivity, additional resting-state data were acquired for 5 minutes
   and a seed-based correlation analysis using Stanford's FIND (Functional
   Imaging in Neuropsychiatric Disorders) atlas was performed.
   Results: The increased sampling rate of SE-MREG relative to SE-SMS and
   SE-EPI improves the sensitivity to detect BOLD activation by 33\% and
   54\%, respectively, and increases the capability to extract
   resting-state networks. Compared with a brain region that is not
   affected by magnetic field inhomogeneities, SE-MREG shows 2.5 times
   higher relative signal strength than GE-MREG in mesial temporal
   structures.
   Conclusion: SE-MREG offers a viable possibility for whole-brain fMRI
   with consideration of brain regions that are affected by strong
   susceptibility-induced magnetic field gradients.},

Abstract = {Robotic assistants have the potential to greatly improve our quality of
   life by supporting us in our daily activities. A service robot acting
   autonomously in an indoor environment is faced with very complex tasks.
   Consider the problem of pouring a liquid into a cup, the robot should
   first determine if the cup is empty or partially filled. RGB-D cameras
   provide noisy depth measurements which depend on the opaqueness and
   refraction index of the liquid. In this paper, we present a novel
   probabilistic approach for estimating the fill level of a liquid in a
   cup using an RGB-D camera. Our approach does not make any assumptions
   about the properties of the liquid like its opaqueness or its refraction
   index. We develop a probabilistic model using features extracted from
   RGB and depth data. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness of our
   method and an improvement over the state of the art.},

Title = {Increased sensitivity of fast BOLD fMRI with a subject-specific
   hemodynamic response function and application to epilepsy},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {93},

Pages = {59-73},

Abstract = {Activation detection in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
   typically assumes the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity to be
   invariant across brain regions and subjects. Reports of substantial
   variability of the morphology of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
   (BOLD) responses are accumulating, suggesting that the use of a single
   generic model of the expected response in general linear model (GLM)
   analyses does not provide optimal sensitivity due to model
   misspecification. Relaxing assumptions of the model can limit the impact
   of hemodynamic response function (HRF) variability, but at a cost on
   model parsimony. Alternatively, better specification of the model could
   be obtained from a priori knowledge of the HRF of a given subject, but
   the effectiveness of this approach has only been tested on simulation
   data. Using fast BOLD fMRI, we characterized the variability of
   hemodynamic responses to a simple event-related auditory-motor task, as
   well as its effect on activation detection with GLM analyses. We show
   the variability to be higher between subjects than between regions and
   variation in different regions to correlate from one subject to the
   other. Accounting for subject-related variability by deriving
   subject-specific models from responses to the task in some regions lead
   to more sensitive detection of responses in other regions. We applied
   the approach to epilepsy patients, where task-derived patient-specific
   models provided additional information compared to the use of a generic
   model for the detection of BOLD responses to epileptiform activity
   identified on scalp electro-encephalogram (EEG). This work highlights
   the importance of improving the accuracy of the model for detecting
   neuronal activation with fMRI, and the fact that it can be done at no
   cost to model parsimony through the acquisition of independent a priori
   information about the hemodynamic response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Planning Decrements in Healthy Aging: Mediation Effects of Fluid
   Reasoning and Working Memory Capacity},

Abstract = {Objectives: Although age-related differences in planning ability are
   well known, their cognitive foundations remain a matter of contention.
   To elucidate the specific processes underlying planning decrements in
   older age, the relative contributions of fluid reasoning, working memory
   (WM) capacity, and processing speed to accuracy on the Tower of London
   (TOL) planning task were investigated.
   Method: Mediation analyses were used to relate overall and search
   depth-related TOL accuracy from older (N = 106; 60-89 years) and younger
   adults (N = 69; 18-54 years) to age and measures of fluid reasoning, WM
   capacity, and speed.
   Results: For overall planning, fluid abilities mediated the effects of
   age, WM capacity, and speed in older adults. By contrast, fluid
   abilities and WM capacity mediated each other in younger adults. For
   planning accuracy under low demands on the depth of search, WM capacity
   was specifically important in older age, whereas younger adults
   recruited both WM capacity and fluid reasoning. Under high
   search-depth-demands, fluid abilities underlay the cognitive operations
   critical for resolving move interdependencies in both age groups.
   Discussion: Fluid abilities and WM capacity undergo significant changes
   from younger to older age in their unique contribution to planning,
   which might represent a mechanism whereby planning decrements in older
   age are brought about.},

Abstract = {Flexible intracortical neural probes elicit a lower foreign body
   response when compared to rigid implants. However, by incorporating
   complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuitry, silicon-based
   neural probes can offer an improved scalability and more functionalities
   than any other currently available technology. Objective: Our goal is
   the development of a novel neural probe that combines flexibility with
   the functionalities of active CMOS-based probes. Methods: We interface
   CMOS-based probe tips of only a few millimeters in length with flexible
   polyimide cables, which enable the complete implantation of the tips
   into brain tissue. The multilayer platinum metallization of the cables
   is patterned using a novel combination of ion beam and plasma etching.
   Implantation of the flexible probes is verified in brain models using
   stiff insertion shuttles. Result: We assembled neural probes from
   passive and active tips as short as 1.5 mm and less than 180 mu m in
   width. Active probes feature electrode arrays with 72 recording sites
   and multiplexing to 16 parallel output lines. We reliably patterned
   cables with signal lines of 2 mu m in width and 3 mu m in spacing. Ion
   beam etching deteriorated the composition of the polyimide substrate and
   its resistance to around 1 k ohm. An additional plasma treatment
   re-established high insulation resistances and recovered the chemical
   composition. Probes were successfully implanted to a depth of 7 mm using
   insertion shuttles and withstood forces of 63 mN. Conclusions: This
   study presents the methods required for the fabrication and application
   of a new generation of neural probes. Significance: The synergetic
   approach surpasses the limitation of each individual probe technology
   and should be considered in future developments.},

Title = {Aphasia recovery by language training using a brain-computer interface:
   a proof-of-concept study},
Journal = {BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The authors report on a novel language training for chronic stroke
   patients with aphasia. It utilizes a closed-loop EEG-based auditory
   brain-computer interface to reinforce suitable processing of word
   stimuli. A proof-of-concept study resulted in a medium to large and
   generalized language improvement independent of aphasia severity and
   speaking ability.
   Aphasia, the impairment to understand or produce language, is a frequent
   disorder after stroke with devastating effects. Conventional speech and
   language therapy include each formal intervention for improving language
   and communication abilities. In the chronic stage after stroke, it is
   effective compared with no treatment, but its effect size is small. We
   present a new language training approach for the rehabilitation of
   patients with aphasia based on a brain-computer interface system. The
   approach exploits its capacity to provide feedback time-locked to a
   brain state. Thus, it implements the idea that reinforcing an
   appropriate language processing strategy may induce beneficial brain
   plasticity. In our approach, patients perform a simple auditory target
   word detection task whilst their EEG was recorded. The constant decoding
   of these signals by machine learning models generates an individual and
   immediate brain-state-dependent feedback. It indicates to patients how
   well they accomplish the task during a training session, even if they
   are unable to speak. Results obtained from a proof-of-concept study with
   10 stroke patients with mild to severe chronic aphasia (age range: 38-76
   years) are remarkable. First, we found that the high-intensity training
   (30 h, 4 days per week) was feasible, despite a high-word presentation
   speed and unfavourable stroke-induced EEG signal characteristics.
   Second, the training induced a sustained recovery of aphasia, which
   generalized to multiple language aspects beyond the trained task.
   Specifically, all tested language assessments (Aachen Aphasia Test,
   Snodgrass \& Vanderwart, Communicative Activity Log) showed significant
   medium to large improvements between pre- and post-training, with a
   standardized mean difference of 0.63 obtained for the Aachen Aphasia
   Test, and five patients categorized as non-aphasic at post-training
   assessment. Third, our data show that these language improvements were
   accompanied neither by significant changes in attention skills nor
   non-linguistic skills. Investigating possible modes of action of this
   brain-computer interface-based language training, neuroimaging data (EEG
   and resting-state functional MRI) indicates a training-induced faster
   word processing, a strengthened language network and a rebalancing
   between the language- and default mode networks.},

Abstract = {In scientific and technical software, floating-point arithmetic is often
   used to approximate arithmetic on physical quantities natively modeled
   as reals. Checking properties for such programs (e.g. proving
   unreachability of code fragments) requires accurate reasoning over
   floating-point arithmetic.
   Currently, most of the SMT-solvers addressing this problem class rely on
   bit-blasting. Recently, methods based on reasoning in interval lattices
   have been lifted from the reals (where they traditionally have been
   successful) to the floating-point numbers. The approach presented in
   this paper follows the latter line of interval-based reasoning, but
   extends it by including bitwise integer operations and cast operations
   between integer and floating-point arithmetic. Such operations have
   hitherto been omitted, as they tend to define sets not concisely
   representable in interval lattices, and were consequently considered the
   domain of bit-blasting approaches. By adding them to interval-based
   reasoning, the full range of basic data types and operations of C
   programs is supported. Furthermore, we propose techniques in order to
   mitigate the problem of aliasing during interval reasoning.
   The experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed
   techniques. Our approach outperforms solvers relying on bit-blasting as
   well as the existing interval-based SMT-solver.},

Abstract = {Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common form of focal,
   pharmacoresistant epilepsy in adults and is often associated with
   hippocampal sclerosis. Here, we established the efficacy of optogenetic
   and electrical low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in interfering with
   seizure generation in a mouse model of MTLE. Specifically, we applied
   LFS in the sclerotic hippocampus to study the effects on spontaneous
   subclinical and evoked generalized seizures. We found that stimulation
   at 1 Hz for 1 hr resulted in an almost complete suppression of
   spontaneous seizures in both hippocampi. This seizure-suppressive action
   during daily stimulation remained stable over several weeks.
   Furthermore, LFS for 30 min before a pro-convulsive stimulus
   successfully prevented seizure generalization. Finally, acute slice
   experiments revealed a reduced efficacy of perforant path transmission
   onto granule cells upon LFS. Taken together, our results suggest that
   hippocampal LFS constitutes a promising approach for seizure control in
   MTLE.},

Abstract = {Neuronal networks confront researchers with an overwhelming complexity
   of interactions between their elements. A common approach to
   understanding neuronal processing is to reduce complexity by defining
   subunits and infer their functional role by selectively modulating them.
   However, this seemingly straightforward approach may lead to confusing
   results if the network exhibits parallel pathways leading to recurrent
   connectivity. We demonstrate limits of the selective modulation approach
   and argue that, even though highly successful in some instances, the
   approach fails in networks with complex connectivity. We argue to refine
   experimental techniques by carefully considering the structural features
   of the neuronal networks involved. Such methods could dramatically
   increase the effectiveness of selective modulation and may lead to a
   mechanistic understanding of principles underlying brain function.},

Title = {Cognitive reserve impacts on disability and cognitive deficits in acute

Abstract = {Objective Although post-stroke cognitive deficit can significantly limit
   patient independence and social re-integration, clinical routine
   predictors for this condition are lacking. `Cognitive reserve' limits
   the detrimental effects of slowly developing neurodegeneration. We aimed
   to determine whether comparable effects also exist in acute stroke.
   Using `years of education' as a proxy, we investigated whether cognitive
   reserve beneficially influences cognitive performance and disability
   after stroke, whilst controlling for age and lesion size as measure of
   stroke pathology. Methods Within the first week of ischemic right
   hemisphere stroke, 36 patients were assessed for alertness, working
   memory, executive functions, spatial neglect, global cognition and motor
   deficit at 4.9 +/- 2.1 days post-stroke, in addition to routine clinical
   tests (NIH Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Scale on admission < 24 h
   post-stroke and at discharge 9.5 +/- 4.7 days post-stroke). The impact
   of education was assessed using partial correlation analysis adjusted
   for lesion size, age, and the time interval between stroke and
   assessment. To validate our results, we compared groups with similar age
   and lesion load, but different education levels. Results In the acute
   stroke phase, years of education predicted both severity of education
   independent (alertness) and education dependent (working memory,
   executive functions, global cognition) cognitive deficits and disability
   (modified Rankin Scale). Spatial neglect seemed to be independent.
   Interpretation Proxies of cognitive reserve should be considered in
   stroke research as early as in the acute stroke phase. Cognitive reserve
   contributes to inter-individual variability in the initial severity of
   cognitive deficits and disability in acute stroke, and may suggest
   individualised rehabilitation strategies.},

Abstract = {MR in microscopy can non-invasively image the morphology of living
   tissue, which is of particular interest in studying the mammalian brain.
   Many studies use live animals for basic research on brain functions,
   disease pathogenesis, and drug development. However, in vitro systems
   are on the rise, due to advantages such as the absence of a blood-brain
   barrier, predictable pharmacokinetics, and reduced ethical restrictions.
   Hence, they present an inexpensive and adequate technique to answer
   scientific questions and to perform drug screenings. Some publications
   report the use of acute brain slices for MR microscopy studies, but
   these only permit single measurements over several hours. Repetitive MR
   measurements in longitudinal studies demand an MR-compatible setup which
   allows cultivation for several days or weeks, and hence properly
   functioning in vitro systems. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures
   (OHSC) are a well-established and robust in vitro system which still
   exhibits most histological hallmarks of the hippocampal network in vivo.
   An MR compatible incubation platform is introduced in which OHSC are
   cultivated according to the interface method following Stoppini et al.
   In this cultivation method a tissue slice is placed onto a membrane with
   nutrition medium underneath and a gas atmosphere above, where the
   air-tissue interface perpendicular to the B-o field induces strong
   artefacts. We introduce a handling protocol that suppresses these
   artefacts and increases signal quality significantly to acquire high
   resolution images of tissue slices. An additional challenge is the lack
   of available of MR microscopy equipment suitable for small animal
   scanners. A Lenz lens with an attached capacitor can dramatically
   increase the SNR in these cases, and wirelessly bring the detection
   system in close proximity to the sample without compromising the OHSC
   system through the introduction of wired detectors. The resultant signal
   gain is demonstrated by imaging a PFA-fixed brain slice with a 72 mm
   diameter volume coil without a Lenz lens, and with a broadband and a
   self-resonant Lenz lens. In our setting, the self-resonant Lenz lens
   increases the SNR 10-fold over using the volume coil only.},

Abstract = {Complex cognitive abilities such as planning are known to critically
   rely on activity of bilateral mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (middlPFC). However, the functional relevance of the structural
   connectivity between left and right mid-dlPFC is yet unknown. Here, we
   applied global tractography to derive streamline counts as estimates of
   the structural connectivity between mid-dlPFC homologs and related it to
   planning performance in the Tower of London task across early to
   midadulthood, assuming a moderating effect of age. Multiple regression
   analyses with interaction effects revealed that streamline counts
   between left and right mid-dlPFC were negatively associated with
   planning performance specifically in early postadolescence. From the
   fourth life decade on, there was a trend for a reversed, positive
   association. These differential findings were corroborated by converging
   results from fractional anisotropy and white-matter density estimates in
   the genu of the corpus callosum where fibers connecting mid-dlPFC
   homologs traversed. Moreover, the results for streamline counts were
   regionally specific, marking the strength of mid-dlPFC connectivity as
   critical in predicting interindividual differences in planning
   performance across different stages of adulthood. Taken together,
   present findings provide first evidence for nonadditive effects of age
   on the relation between complex cognitive abilities and the structural
   connectivity of mid-dlPFC homologs.},

Title = {Negative BOLD in default-mode structures measured with EEG-MREG is
   larger in temporal than extra-temporal epileptic spikes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Introduction: EEG-fMRI detects BOLD changes associated with epileptic
   interictal discharges (IED) and can identify epileptogenic networks in
   epilepsy patients. Besides positive BOLD changes, negative BOLD changes
   have sometimes been observed in the default mode network, particularly
   using group analysis. A new fast fMRI sequence called MREG (Magnetic
   Resonance Encephalography) shows increased sensitivity to detect IED
   related BOLD changes compared to the conventional EPI sequence,
   including frequent occurrence of negative BOLD responses in the DMN. The
   present study quantifies the concordance between the DMN and negative
   BOLD related to IEDs of temporal and extra-temporal origin.
   Methods: Focal epilepsy patients underwent simultaneous EEG-MREG. Areas
   of overlap were calculated between DMN regions, defined as precuneus,
   posterior cingulate, bilateral inferior parietal and mesial prefrontal
   cortices according to a standardized atlas, and significant negative
   BOLD changes revealed by an event-related analysis based on the timings
   of IED seen on EEG. Correlation between IED number/lobe of origin and
   the overlap were calculated.
   Results: 15 patients were analyzed, some showing IED over more than one
   location resulting in 30 different IED types. The average overlap
   between negative BOLD and DMN was significantly larger in temporal (23.7
   +/- 19.6 cm(3)) than extra-temporal IEDs (7.4 +/- 5.1 cm(3), p = 0.008).
   There was no significant correlation between the number of IEDs and the
   overlap between DMN structures and negative BOLD areas.
   Discussion: MREG results in an increased sensitivity to detect negative
   BOLD responses related to focal IED in single patients, with responses
   often occurring in DMN regions. In patients with high overlap with the
   DMN, this suggests that epileptic IEDs may be associated with a brief
   decrease in attention and cognitive ability. Interestingly this
   observation was not dependent on the frequency of IED but more common in
   IED of temporal origin.},

Title = {Transcriptional characterization of the glial response due to chronic
   neural implantation of flexible microprobes},
Journal = {BIOMATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {279},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Long term implantation of (micro-)probes into neural tissue causes
   unique and disruptive responses. In this study, we investigate the
   transcriptional trajectory of glial cells responding to chronic
   implantation of 380 mu m flexible micro-probes for up to 18 weeks.
   Transcriptomic analysis shows a rapid activation of microglial cells and
   a strong reactive astrocytic polarization, both of which are lost over
   the chronic of the implant duration. Animals that were implanted for 18
   weeks show a transcriptional profile similar to non-implanted controls,
   with increased expression of genes associated with wound healing and
   angiogenesis, which raises hope of a normalization of the neuropil to
   the pre-injury state when using flexible probes. Nevertheless, our data
   shows that a subset of genes upregulated after 18 weeks belong to the
   family of immediate early genes, which indicates that structural and
   functional remodeling is not complete at this time point. Our results
   confirm and extend previous work on the molecular changes resulting from
   the presence of neural probes and provide a rational basis for
   developing interventional strategies to control them.},

Title = {Assessment of Planning Ability: Psychometric Analyses on the
   Unidimensionality and Construct Validity of the Tower of London Task
   (TOL-F)},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective: The Tower of London (TOL) is widely used to assess planning
   ability as a prototypical executive function in healthy and clinical
   populations. Despite its popularity, there is still no consensus on (a)
   whether the TOL measures a psychometrically unidimensional trait, and
   (b) how differences in problem structure relate to the difficulty of
   individual items. Method: Employing the framework of factor analysis and
   item response theory we investigated these issues of construct validity
   in a sample of 798 participants (443 female; 16 to 84 years).
   Participants worked on the TOL-Freiburg version (TOL-F) comprising a set
   of 24 4- to 6-move problems, which-based on comprehensive cognitive task
   analyses-systematically differ with regard to several structural problem
   parameters (minimum number of moves, search depth, goal hierarchy).
   Results: Results revealed that TOL-F performance is mainly explained by
   1 major factor, while further minor factors additionally account for
   smaller, but possibly still informative, shares of variance. Individual
   item difficulties can be predicted by the experimentally varied problem
   parameters to a high degree (r = .89) and can be considered stable
   across different levels of age, sex, education, and planning ability.
   Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the TOL-F's construct validity as
   measuring planning ability in terms of an essentially unidimensional
   cognitive function while adhering to theory-driven concepts of task
   difficulty. TOL-F task performance hence represents an accurate, robust,
   and theoretically grounded estimation of a participant's planning
   ability. The results further highlight the merit of using established
   concepts from experimental psychology for improving neuropsychological
   assessment.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present techniques that enable a humanoid to
   autonomously play instruments like the metal-lophone. The core of our
   approach is a model-based method to estimate the pose of the instrument
   and the beaters held by the robot using observations from the onboard
   camera. For accurate playing, we calibrate the kinematic parameters of
   the robot and find valid configurations of the arms for beating the
   individual sound bars of the instrument. To determine these, we rely on
   the estimated pose of the instrument and the beaters and apply inverse
   kinematics (IK). Hereby, we use precomputed forward kinematics solutions
   represented by a reachability tree to accelerate the IK computation and
   compensate for local minima. The robot automatically validates the
   computed IK configurations based on visual and auditory feedback using
   its sensors, and adapts its arm configurations if necessary. Our system
   parses MIDI-files of whole songs, maps the notes to the corresponding
   arm configurations for beating, and generates trajectories in joint
   space to hit the sound bars. As we show in the experiments with a Nao
   humanoid presented in this paper as well as in the accompanying video,
   our approach allows for clean and in-time playing of complete songs on a
   metallophone.},

Title = {Processing of Feature Selectivity in Cortical Networks with Specific
   Connectivity},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Although non-specific at the onset of eye opening, networks in rodent
   visual cortex attain a non-random structure after eye opening, with a
   specific bias for connections between neurons of similar preferred
   orientations. As orientation selectivity is already present at eye
   opening, it remains unclear how this specificity in network wiring
   contributes to feature selectivity. Using large-scale
   inhibition-dominated spiking networks as a model, we show that
   feature-specific connectivity leads to a linear amplification of
   feedforward tuning, consistent with recent electrophysiological
   single-neuron recordings in rodent neocortex. Our results show that
   optimal amplification is achieved at an intermediate regime of specific
   connectivity. In this configuration a moderate increase of pairwise
   correlations is observed, consistent with recent experimental findings.
   Furthermore, we observed that feature-specific connectivity leads to the
   emergence of orientation-selective reverberating activity, and entails
   pattern completion in network responses. Our theoretical analysis
   provides a mechanistic understanding of subnetworks' responses to visual
   stimuli, and casts light on the regime of operation of sensory cortices
   in the presence of specific connectivity.},

Title = {Position- and Time-Dependent Arc Expression Links Neuronal Activity to
   Synaptic Plasticity During Epileptogenesis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) an initial precipitating injury
   can trigger aberrant wiring of neuronal circuits causing seizure
   activity. While circuit reorganization is known to be largely
   activity-dependent, the interactions between neuronal activity and
   synaptic plasticity during the development of mTLE remain poorly
   understood. Therefore, the present study aimed at delineating the
   spatiotemporal relationship between epileptic activity,
   activity-dependent gene expression and synaptic plasticity during kainic
   acid-induced epileptogenesis in mice. We show that during
   epileptogenesis the sclerotic hippocampus differed from non-sclerotic
   regions by displaying a consistently lower power of paroxysmal
   discharges. However, the power of these discharges steadily increased
   during epileptogenesis. This increase was paralleled by the upregulation
   of the activity-related cytoskeleton protein (Arc) gene expression in
   dentate granule cells (DGCs) of the sclerotic hippocampus. Importantly,
   we found that Arc mRNA-upregulating DGCs exhibited increased spine
   densities and spine sizes, but at the same time decreased AMPA-type
   glutamate receptor (AMPAR) densities. Finally, we show that in vivo
   optogenetic stimulation of DGC synapses evoked robust seizure activity
   in epileptic mice, but failed to induce dendritic translocation of Arc
   mRNA as under healthy conditions, supporting the theory of a breakdown
   of the dentate gate in mTLE. We conclude that during epileptogenesis
   epileptic activity emerges early and persists in the whole hippocampus,
   however, only the sclerotic part shows modulation of discharge
   amplitudes accompanied by plasticity of DGCs. In this context, we
   identified Arc as a putative mediator between seizure activity and
   synaptic plasticity.},

Title = {Respiratory-related brain pulsations are increased in epilepsy-a
   two-centre functional MRI study},
Journal = {BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Resting-state functional MRI has shown potential for detecting changes
   in cerebral blood oxygen level-dependent signal in patients with
   epilepsy, even in the absence of epileptiform activity. Furthermore, it
   has been suggested that coefficient of variation mapping of fast
   functional MRI signal may provide a powerful tool for the identification
   of intrinsic brain pulsations in neurological diseases such as dementia,
   stroke and epilepsy. In this study, we used fast functional MRI sequence
   (magnetic resonance encephalography) to acquire ten whole-brain images
   per second. We used the functional MRI data to compare physiological
   brain pulsations between healthy controls (n = 102) and patients with
   epilepsy (n = 33) and furthermore to drug-naive seizure patients (n =
   9). Analyses were performed by calculating coefficient of variation and
   spectral power in full band and filtered sub-bands. Brain pulsations in
   the respiratory-related frequency sub-band (0.11-0.51Hz) were
   significantly (P < 0.05) increased in patients with epilepsy, with an
   increase in both signal variance and power. At the individual level,
   over 80\% of medicated and drug-naive seizure patients exhibited areas
   of abnormal brain signal power that correlated well with the known
   clinical diagnosis, while none of the controls showed signs of
   abnormality with the same threshold. The differences were most apparent
   in the basal brain structures, respiratory centres of brain stem,
   midbrain and temporal lobes. Notably, full-band, very low frequency
   (0.01-0.1Hz) and cardiovascular (0.8-1.76Hz) brain pulses showed no
   differences between groups. This study extends and confirms our previous
   results of abnormal fast functional MRI signal variance in epilepsy
   patients. Only respiratory-related brain pulsations were clearly
   increased with no changes in either physiological cardiorespiratory
   rates or head motion between the subjects. The regional alterations in
   brain pulsations suggest that mechanisms driving the cerebrospinal fluid
   homeostasis may be altered in epilepsy. Magnetic resonance
   encephalography has both increased sensitivity and high specificity for
   detecting the increased brain pulsations, particularly in times when
   other tools for locating epileptogenic areas remain inconclusive.},

Abstract = {Interpreting the brain activity to identify user goals or to ground a
   robot's hypotheses about them is a promising direction for non-intrusive
   and intuitive communication. Such a capability can be of particular
   relevance in the context of human-robot cooperation scenarios. This
   paper proposes a novel approach to utilize the natural brain responses
   to highlighted objects in the scene for object selection. By this, it
   circumvents the need for additional interfaces or user training. Our
   approach uses methods from information geometry to classify the
   target/non-target response of these event-related potentials. Online
   experiments carried out with a real robot demonstrate an accurate
   detection of target objects solely based on the user's attention.},

Abstract = {The neuromodulator dopamine plays a key role in motivation,
   reward-related learning, and normal motor function. The different
   affinity of striatal D1 and D2 dopamine receptor types has been argued
   to constrain the D1 and D2 signaling pathways to phasic and tonic
   dopamine signals, respectively. However, this view assumes that dopamine
   receptor kinetics are instantaneous so that the time courses of changes
   in dopamine concentration and changes in receptor occupation are
   basically identical. Here we developed a neurochemical model of dopamine
   receptor binding taking into account the different kinetics and
   abundance of D1 and D2 receptors in the striatum. Testing a large range
   of behaviorally-relevant dopamine signals, we found that the D1 and D2
   dopamine receptor populations responded very similarly to tonic and
   phasic dopamine signals. Furthermore, because of slow unbinding rates,
   both receptor populations integrated dopamine signals over a timescale
   of minutes. Our model provides a description of how physiological
   dopamine signals translate into changes in dopamine receptor occupation
   in the striatum, and explains why dopamine ramps are an effective signal
   to occupy dopamine receptors. Overall, our model points to the
   importance of taking into account receptor kinetics for functional
   considerations of dopamine signaling.},

Title = {Fast fMRI provides high statistical power in the analysis of epileptic
   networks},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {282-294},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {EEG-fMRI is a unique method to combine the high temporal resolution of
   EEG with the high spatial resolution of MRI to study generators of
   intrinsic brain signals such as sleep grapho-elements or epileptic
   spikes. While the standard EPI sequence in fMRI experiments has a
   temporal resolution of around 2.5-3 s a newly established fast fMRI
   sequence called MREG (Magnetic-Resonance-Encephalography) provides a
   temporal resolution of around 100 ms. This technical novelty promises to
   improve statistics, facilitate correction of physiological artifacts and
   improve the understanding of epileptic networks in fMRI. The present
   study compares simultaneous EEG-EP1 and EEG-MREG analyzing epileptic
   spikes to determine the yield of fast MRI in the analysis of intrinsic
   brain signals.
   Patients with frequent interictal spikes (>3120 min) underwent EEG-MREG
   and EEG-EPI (3 T, 20 min each, voxel size 3 x 3 x 3 mm, EPI TR= 2.61s,
   MREG TR = 0.1 s). Timings of the spikes were used in an event-related
   analysis to generate activation maps oft-statistics. (FMRISTAT, vertical
   bar t vertical bar > 3.5, cluster size: 7 voxels, p < 0.05 corrected).
   For both sequences, the amplitude and location of significant BOLD
   activations were compared with the spike topography. 13 patients were
   recorded and 33 different spike types could be analyzed. Peak T-values
   were significantly higher in MREG than in EPI (p<0.0001). Positive BOLD
   effects correlating with the spike topography were found in 8/29 spike
   types using the EP1 and in 22/33 spikes types using the MREG sequence.
   Negative BOLD responses in the default mode network could be observed in
   3/29 spike types with the EPI and in 19/33 with the MREG sequence. With
   the latter method, BOLD changes were observed even when few spikes
   occurred during the investigation. Simultaneous EEG-MREG thus is
   possible with good EEG quality and shows higher sensitivity in regard to
   the localization of spike-related BOLD responses than EEG-EPI. The
   development of new methods of analysis for this sequence such as
   modeling of physiological noise, temporal analysis of the BOLD signal
   and defining appropriate thresholds is required to fully profit from its
   high temporal resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigate the influence of inhomogeneous broadening on the optical
   polarization properties of high-inclination semipolar and nonpolar
   InxGa1-xN/GaN quantum wells. Different planar m-plane and (20 (2) over
   bar(1) over bar) samples were grown (including core-shell microrods) and
   have been characterized by excitation-dependent polarization-resolved
   confocal micro-photoluminescence. The measured degree of linear
   polarization (DLP) is compared to theoretical predictions obtained by
   Fermi-Dirac statistical filling of the electronic band structure
   calculated by the k . p envelope function method. We show that our
   measured DLP at room temperature, as well as values reported by other
   groups, are systematically higher than the theoretical predictions. We
   propose to solve this discrepancy between theory and experiment by
   introducing inhomogeneous broadening in our calculations. Considering
   indium content fluctuations and the localization lengths of electrons
   and holes, different effective broadenings are applied to different
   subsets of subbands. We thereby show that inhomogeneous broadening leads
   to an increase of the DLP at room temperature. Furthermore, the
   dependence of the optical properties on the excitation density is better
   reproduced. Looking at the DLP as a function of the temperature gives us
   insight into the thermalization dynamics of charge carriers.},

Title = {The role of ECoG magnitude and phase in decoding position, velocity, and
   acceleration during continuous motor behavior},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {In neuronal population signals, including the electroencephalogram (EEG)
   and electrocorticogram (ECoG), the low-frequency component (LFC) is
   particularly informative about motor behavior and can be used for
   decoding movement parameters for brain-machine interface (BMI)
   applications. An idea previously expressed, but as of yet not
   quantitatively tested, is that it is the LFC phase that is the main
   source of decodable information. To test this issue, we analyzed human
   ECoG recorded during a game-like, one-dimensional, continuous motor task
   with a novel decoding method suitable for unfolding magnitude and phase
   explicitly into a complex-valued, time-frequency signal representation,
   enabling quantification of the decodable information within the
   temporal, spatial and frequency domains and allowing disambiguation of
   the phase contribution from that of the spectral magnitude. The decoding
   accuracy based only on phase information was substantially (at least 2
   fold) and significantly higher than that based only on magnitudes for
   position, velocity and acceleration. The frequency profile of
   movement-related information in the ECoG data matched well with the
   frequency profile expected when assuming a close time-domain correlate
   of movement velocity in the ECoG, e.g., a (noisy) ``copy{''} of hand
   velocity. No such match was observed with the frequency profiles
   expected when assuming a copy of either hand position or acceleration.
   There was also no indication of additional magnitude-based mechanisms
   encoding movement information in the LFC range. Thus, our study
   contributes to elucidating the nature of the informative LFC of motor
   cortical population activity and may hence contribute to improve
   decoding strategies and BMI performance.},

Abstract = {Objective: The array of available brain-computer interface (BCI)
   paradigms has continued to grow, and so has the corresponding set of
   machine learning methods which are at the core of BCI systems. The
   latter have evolved to provide more robust data analysis solutions, and
   as a consequence the proportion of healthy BCI users who can use a BCI
   successfully is growing. With this development the chances have
   increased that the needs and abilities of specific patients, the
   end-users, can be covered by an existing BCI approach. However, most
   end-users who have experienced the use of a BCI system at all have
   encountered a single paradigm only. This paradigm is typically the one
   that is being tested in the study that the end-user happens to be
   enrolled in, along with other end-users. Though this corresponds to the
   preferred study arrangement for basic research, it does not ensure that
   the end-user experiences a working BCI. In this study, a different
   approach was taken; that of a user-centered design. It is the prevailing
   process in traditional assistive technology. Given an individual user
   with a particular clinical profile, several available BCI approaches are
   tested and - if necessary - adapted to him/her until a suitable BCI
   system is found.
   Methods: Described is the case of a 48-year-old woman who suffered from
   an ischemic brain stem stroke, leading to a severe motor- and
   communication deficit. She was enrolled in studies with two different
   BCI systems before a suitable system was found. The first was an
   auditory event-related potential (ERP) paradigm and the second a visual
   ERP paradigm, both of which are established in literature.
   Results: The auditory paradigm did not work successfully, despite
   favorable preconditions. The visual paradigm worked flawlessly, as found
   over several sessions. This discrepancy in performance can possibly be
   explained by the user's clinical deficit in several key
   neuropsychological indicators, such as attention and working memory.
   While the auditory paradigm relies on both categories, the visual
   paradigm could be used with lower cognitive workload. Besides attention
   and working memory, several other neurophysiological and -psychological
   indicators - and the role they play in the BCIs at hand - are discussed.
   Conclusion: The user's performance on the first BCI paradigm would
   typically have excluded her from further ERP-based BCI studies. However,
   this study clearly shows that, with the numerous paradigms now at our
   disposal, the pursuit for a functioning BCI system should not be stopped
   after an initial failed attempt. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Title = {On the optical polarization properties of semipolar (20(2)over-bar1) and
   (20(2)over-bar(1)over-bar) InGaN/GaN quantum wells},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Number = {8},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {In the framework of k . p-theory, semipolar (20 (2) over bar1) and (20
   (2) over bar(1) over bar) InGaN/GaN quantum wells (QWs) have equivalent
   band structures and are expected to have identical optical polarization
   properties. However, (20 (2) over bar1) QWs consistently exhibit a lower
   degree of linear polarization (DLP) than (20 (2) over bar(1) over bar)
   QWs. To understand this peculiarity, we investigate the optical
   properties of (20 (2) over bar1) and (20 (2) over bar(1) over bar)
   InGaN/GaN single QW light-emitting diodes (LEDs) via resonant
   polarization-resolved photoluminescence microscopy. LEDs were grown on
   bulk substrates by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy with different
   indium concentrations resulting in emission wavelengths between 442 nm
   and 491 nm. We discuss the origin of their DLP via k . p band structure
   calculations. An analytical expression to estimate the DLP in the
   Boltzmann-regime is proposed. Measurements of the DLP at 10 K and 300 K
   are compared to m-plane LEDs and highlight several discrepancies with
   calculations. We observe a strong correlation between DLPs and spectral
   widths, which indicates that inhomogeneous broadening affects the
   optical polarization properties. Considering indium content
   fluctuations, QW thickness fluctuations, and the localization length of
   charge carriers, we argue that different broadenings apply to each
   subband and introduce a formalism using effective masses to account for
   inhomogeneous broadening in the calculation of the DLP. We conclude that
   the different DLP of (20 (2) over bar1) and (20 (2) over bar(1) over
   bar) QWs might be related to different effective broadenings of their
   valence subbands induced by the rougher upper QW interface in (20 (2)
   over bar1), by the larger sensitivity of holes to this upper interface
   due to the polarization field in (20 (2) over bar, and/or by the
   different degrees of localization of holes. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Title = {Real-time detection of neural oscillation bursts allows behaviourally
   relevant neurofeedback},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Neural oscillations as important information carrier in the brain, are
   increasingly interpreted as transient bursts rather than as sustained
   oscillations. Short (<150 ms) bursts of beta-waves (15-30 Hz) have been
   documented in humans, monkeys and mice. These events were correlated
   with memory, movement and perception, and were even suggested as the
   primary ingredient of all beta-band activity. However, a method to
   measure these short-lived events in real-time and to investigate their
   impact on behaviour is missing. Here we present a real-time data
   analysis system, capable to detect short narrowband bursts, and
   demonstrate its usefulness to increase the beta-band burst-rate in rats.
   This neurofeedback training induced changes in overall oscillatory
   power, and bursts could be decoded from the movement of the rats, thus
   enabling future investigation of the role of oscillatory bursts.
   Karvat et al. describe a real-time digital signal-processing method to
   detect neural oscillations in the form of short and narrowband bursts.
   Using this real-time method, they show that neurofeedback increases
   burst-related behaviours and that these bursts can be decoded from the
   movements of the rats.},

Title = {Hippocampus-Avoidance Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy Is Efficient in the
   Long-Term Preservation of Hippocampal Volume},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {Background and Purpose: With improved life expectancy, preventing
   neurocognitive decline after cerebral radiotherapy is gaining more
   importance. Hippocampal damage has been considered the main culprit for
   cognitive deficits following conventional whole-brain radiation therapy
   (WBRT). Here, we aimed to determine to which extent hippocampusavoidance
   WBRT ( HA- WBRT) can prevent hippocampal atrophy compared to
   conventional WBRT. Methods and Materials: Thirty-five HA-WBRT and 48
   WBRT patients were retrospectively selected, comprising a total of 544
   contrast-enhanced T1- weighted magnetic resonance imaging studies,
   longitudinally acquired within 24 months before and 48 months after
   radiotherapy. HA-WBRT patients were treated analogously to the ongoing
   HIPPORAD-trial (DRKS00004598) protocol with 30 Gy in 12 fractions and
   dose to 98\% of the hippocampus = 9 Gy and to 2\% = 17 Gy. WBRT was
   mainly performed with 35 Gy in 14 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions.
   Anatomical images were segmented and the hippocampal volume was
   quantified using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT), including
   neuroradiological expert review of the segmentations. Results: After
   statistically controlling for confounding variables such as age, gender,
   and total intracranial volume, hippocampal atrophy was found after both
   WBRT and HAWBRT (p < 10-6). However, hippocampal decline across time
   following HA-WBRT was approximately three times lower than following
   conventional WBRT (p < 10-6), with an average atrophy of 3.1\% versus
   8.5\% in the first 2 years after radiation therapy, respectively.
   Conclusion: HA- WBRT is a therapeutic option for patients with multiple
   brain metastases, which can effectively and durably minimize hippocampal
   atrophy compared to conventional WBRT.},

Title = {The ventral pathway of the human brain: A continuous association tract
   system},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {234},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {The brain hemispheres can be divided into an upper dorsal and a lower
   ventral system. Each system consists of distinct cortical regions
   connected via long association tracts. The tracts cross the central
   sulcus or the limen insulae to connect the frontal lobe with the
   posterior brain. The dorsal stream is associated with sensorimotor
   mapping. The ventral stream serves structural analysis and semantics in
   different domains, as visual, acoustic or space processing. How does the
   prefrontal cortex, regarded as the platform for the highest level of
   integration, incorporate information from these different domains? In
   the current view, the ventral pathway consists of several separate
   tracts, related to different modalities. Originally the assumption was
   that the ventral path is a continuum, covering all modalities. The
   latter would imply a very different anatomical basis for cognitive and
   clinical models of processing. To further define the ventral
   connections, we used cutting-edge in vivo global tractography on
   highresolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 100 normal
   subjects from the human connectome project and ex vivo preparation of
   fiber bundles in the extreme capsule of 8 humans using the Klingler
   technique. Our data showed that ventral stream tracts, traversing
   through the extreme capsule, form a continuous band of fibers that fan
   out anteriorly to the prefrontal cortex, and posteriorly to temporal,
   occipital and parietal cortical regions. Introduction of additional
   volumes of interest in temporal and occipital lobes differentiated
   between the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) and uncinate
   fascicle (UF). Unequivocally, in both experiments, in all subjects a
   connection between the inferior frontal and middle-to-posterior temporal
   cortical region, otherwise known as the temporo-frontal extreme capsule
   fascicle (ECF) from nonhuman primate brain-tracing experiments was
   identified. In the human brain, this tract connects the language domains
   of ``Broca's area `` and ``Wernicke's area ``. The differentiation in
   the three tracts, IFOF, UF and ECF seems arbitrary, all three pass
   through the extreme capsule. Our data show that the ventral pathway
   represents a continuum. The three tracts merge seamlessly and
   streamlines showed considerable overlap in their anterior and posterior
   course. Terminal maps identified prefrontal cortex in the frontal lobe
   and association cortex in temporal, occipital and parietal lobes as
   streamline endings. This anatomical substrate potentially facilitates
   the prefrontal cortex to integrate information across different domains
   and modalities.},

Title = {Autonomous Optimization of Targeted Stimulation of Neuronal Networks},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Driven by clinical needs and progress in neurotechnology, targeted
   interaction with neuronal networks is of increasing importance. Yet, the
   dynamics of interaction between intrinsic ongoing activity in neuronal
   networks and their response to stimulation is unknown. Nonetheless,
   electrical stimulation of the brain is increasingly explored as a
   therapeutic strategy and as a means to artificially inject information
   into neural circuits. Strategies using regular or event-triggered fixed
   stimuli discount the influence of ongoing neuronal activity on the
   stimulation outcome and are therefore not optimal to induce specific
   responses reliably. Yet, without suitable mechanistic models, it is
   hardly possible to optimize such interactions, in particular when
   desired response features are network-dependent and are initially
   unknown. In this proof-of-principle study, we present an experimental
   paradigm using reinforcement-learning (RL) to optimize stimulus settings
   autonomously and evaluate the learned control strategy using
   phenomenological models. We asked how to (1) capture the interaction of
   ongoing network activity, electrical stimulation and evoked responses in
   a quantifiable `state' to formulate a well-posed control problem, (2)
   find the optimal state for stimulation, and (3) evaluate the quality of
   the solution found. Electrical stimulation of generic neuronal networks
   grown from rat cortical tissue in vitro evoked bursts of action
   potentials (responses). We show that the dynamic interplay of their
   magnitudes and the probability to be intercepted by spontaneous events
   defines a trade-off scenario with a network-specific unique optimal
   latency maximizing stimulus efficacy. An RL controller was set to find
   this optimum autonomously. Across networks, stimulation efficacy
   increased in 90\% of the sessions after learning and learned latencies
   strongly agreed with those predicted from open-loop experiments. Our
   results show that autonomous techniques can exploit quantitative
   relationships underlying activity-response interaction in biological
   neuronal networks to choose optimal actions. Simple phenomenological
   models can be useful to validate the quality of the resulting
   controllers.},

Title = {A starting kit for training and establishing in vivo electrophysiology,
   intracranial pharmacology, and optogenetics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {336},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Background: In accordance with the three R principles of research,
   animal usage should be limited as much as possible. Especially for the
   training of entry-level scientists in surgical techniques underlying
   opto- and electrophysiology, alternative training tools are required
   before moving on to live animals. We have developed a cost-effective rat
   brain model for training a wide range of surgical techniques, including,
   but not limited to optogenetics, electrophysiology, and intracranial
   pharmacological treatments.
   Results: Our brain model creates a realistic training experience in
   animal surgery. The success of the surgeries (e.g. implantation
   accuracy) is readily assessable in cross sections of the model brain.
   Moreover, the model allows practicing electrophysiological recordings as
   well as testing for movement or light related artefacts. Comparison with
   Existing Method(s): The surgery and recording experience in our model
   closely resembles that in an actual rat in terms of the necessary
   techniques, considerations and time span. A few differences to an actual
   rat brain slightly reduce the difficulty in our model compared to a live
   animal. Thus, entry level scientists can first learn basic techniques in
   our model before moving on to the slightly more complex procedures in
   live animals.
   Conclusions: Our brain model is a useful training tool to equip
   scientist who are new in the field of electrophysiology and optogenetic
   manipulations with a basic skill set before applying it in live animals.
   It can be adapted to fit the desired training content or even to serve
   in testing and optimizing new lab equipment for more senior scientists.},

Title = {Localization Accuracy of Distributed Inverse Solutions for Electric and

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Distributed inverse solutions aim to realistically reconstruct the
   origin of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) from noninvasively
   recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)
   signals. Our aim was to compare the performance of different distributed
   inverse solutions in localizing IEDs: coherent maximum entropy on the
   mean (cMEM), hierarchical Bayesian implementations of independent
   identically distributed sources (IID, minimum norm prior) and spatially
   coherent sources (COH, spatial smoothness prior). Source maxima (i.e.,
   the vertex with the maximum source amplitude) of IEDs in 14 EEG and 19
   MEG studies from 15 patients with focal epilepsy were analyzed. We
   visually compared their concordance with intracranial EEG (iEEG) based
   on 17 cortical regions of interest and their spatial dispersion around
   source maxima. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) maxima from cMEM were most
   often confirmed by iEEG (cMEM: 14/19, COH: 9/19, IID: 8/19 studies). COH
   electric source imaging (ESI) maxima co-localized best with iEEG (cMEM:
   8/14, COH: 11/14, IID: 10/14 studies). In addition, cMEM was less
   spatially spread than COH and IID for ESI and MSI (p < 0.001
   Bonferroni-corrected post hoc t test). Highest positive predictive
   values for cortical regions with IEDs in iEEG could be obtained with
   cMEM for MSI and with COH for ESI. Additional realistic EEG/MEG
   simulations confirmed our findings. Accurate spatially extended sources,
   as found in cMEM (ESI and MSI) and COH (ESI) are desirable for source
   imaging of IEDs because this might influence surgical decision. Our
   simulations suggest that COH and IID overestimate the spatial extent of
   the generators compared to cMEM.},

Title = {Network remodeling induced by transcranial brain stimulation: A
   computational model of tDCS-triggered cell assembly formation},
Journal = {NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Pages = {924-943},
Abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a variant of
   noninvasive neuromodulation, which promises treatment for brain diseases
   like major depressive disorder. In experiments, long-lasting
   aftereffects were observed, suggesting that persistent plastic changes
   are induced. The mechanism underlying the emergence of lasting
   aftereffects, however, remains elusive. Here we propose a model, which
   assumes that tDCS triggers a homeostatic response of the network
   involving growth and decay of synapses. The cortical tissue exposed to
   tDCS is conceived as a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory
   neurons, with synapses subject to homeostatically regulated structural
   plasticity. We systematically tested various aspects of stimulation,
   including electrode size and montage, as well as stimulation intensity
   and duration. Our results suggest that transcranial stimulation perturbs
   the homeostatic equilibrium and leads to a pronounced growth response of
   the network. The stimulated population eventually eliminates excitatory
   synapses with the unstimulated population, and new synapses among
   stimulated neurons are grown to form a cell assembly. Strong focal
   stimulation tends to enhance the connectivity within new cell
   assemblies, and repetitive stimulation with well-chosen duty cycles can
   increase the impact of stimulation even further. One long-term goal of
   our work is to help in optimizing the use of tDCS in clinical
   applications. Author SummaryNoninvasive brain stimulation techniques
   like tDCS have the potential to directly interfere with neural activity,
   but may also trigger activity-dependent plasticity. We propose a model
   to study the mechanism of tDCS and persistent aftereffects that may be
   induced as a consequence of homeostatic structural plasticity. Based on
   the idea that tDCS perturbs the ongoing activity of neurons, our model
   predicts that the stimulation also triggers a rearrangement of synapses
   among stimulated and unstimulated neurons, eventually leading to network
   remodeling and cell assembly formation. Focal and strong stimulation
   leads to stronger cell assemblies, and so does repetitive stimulation
   with optimized stimulation protocols. This is the first original work
   studying possible long-lasting aftereffects of transcranial stimulation
   at the mesoscopic neuronal network level using a computational model.},

Title = {Emergence of Functional Specificity in Balanced Networks with Synaptic
   Plasticity},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In rodent visual cortex, synaptic connections between
   orientation-selective neurons are unspecific at the time of eye opening,
   and become to some degree functionally specific only later during
   development. An explanation for this two-stage process was proposed in
   terms of Hebbian plasticity based on visual experience that would
   eventually enhance connections between neurons with similar response
   features. For this to work, however, two conditions must be satisfied:
   First, orientation selective neuronal responses must exist before
   specific recurrent synaptic connections can be established. Second,
   Hebbian learning must be compatible with the recurrent network dynamics
   contributing to orientation selectivity, and the resulting specific
   connectivity must remain stable for unspecific background activity.
   Previous studies have mainly focused on very simple models, where the
   receptive fields of neurons were essentially determined by feedforward
   mechanisms, and where the recurrent network was small, lacking the
   complex recurrent dynamics of large-scale networks of excitatory and
   inhibitory neurons. Here we studied the emergence of functionally
   specific connectivity in large-scale recurrent networks with synaptic
   plasticity. Our results show that balanced random networks, which
   already exhibit highly selective responses at eye opening, can develop
   feature-specific connectivity if appropriate rules of synaptic
   plasticity are invoked within and between excitatory and inhibitory
   populations. If these conditions are met, the initial orientation
   selectivity guides the process of Hebbian learning and, as a result,
   functionally specific and a surplus of bidirectional connections emerge.
   Our results thus demonstrate the cooperation of synaptic plasticity and
   recurrent dynamics in large-scale functional networks with realistic
   receptive fields, highlight the role of inhibition as a critical element
   in this process, and paves the road for further computational studies of
   sensory processing in neocortical network models equipped with synaptic
   plasticity.},

Title = {Differential vulnerability of interneurons in the epileptic hippocampus},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The loss of hippocampal interneurons has been considered as one reason
   for the onset of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) by shifting the
   excitation-inhibition balance. Yet, there are many different interneuron
   types which show differential vulnerability in the context of an
   epileptogenic insult. We used the intrahippocampal kainate (KA) mouse
   model for TLE in which a focal, unilateral KA injection induces status
   epilepticus (SE) followed by development of granule cell dispersion
   (GCD) and hippocampal sclerosis surrounding the injection site but not
   in the intermediate and temporal hippocampus. In this study, we
   characterized the loss of interneurons with respect to septotemporal
   position and to differential vulnerability of interneuron populations.
   To this end, we performed intrahippocampal recordings of the initial SE,
   in situ hybridization for glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) mRNA
   and immunohistochemistry for parvalbumin (PV) and neuropeptide Y (NPY)
   in the early phase of epileptogenesis at 2 days and at 21 days after KA
   injection, when recurrent epileptic activity and GCD have fully
   developed. We show that SE extended along the entire septotemporal axis
   of both hippocampi, but was stronger at distant sites than at the
   injection site. There was an almost complete loss of interneurons
   surrounding the injection site and expanding to the intermediate
   hippocampus already at 2 days but increasing until 21 days after KA.
   Furthermore, we observed differential vulnerability of PV- and
   NPY-expressing cells: while the latter were lost at the injection site
   but preserved at intermediate sites, PV-expressing cells were gone even
   at sites more temporal than GCD. In addition, we found upregulation of
   GAD67 mRNA expression in dispersed granule cells and of NPY staining in
   ipsilateral granule cells and ipsi- and contralateral mossy fibers. Our
   data thus indicate differential survival capacity of interneurons in the
   epileptic hippocampus and compensatory plasticity mechanisms depending
   on the hippocampal position.},

   automatically generates test patterns for integrated circuits and (2)
   the observation that off-the-shelf state-of-the-art pseudo-Boolean
   solvers have difficulties in solving instances with huge pseudo-Boolean
   constraints as created by our application.
   Derived from the SMT solver iSAT3 we present the solver iSAT3p that on
   the one hand allows the efficient handling of huge pseudo-Boolean
   constraints with several thousand summands and large integer
   coefficients. On the other hand, experimental results demonstrate that
   at the same time iSAT3p is competitive or even superior to other solvers
   on standard pseudo-Boolean benchmark families.},

Abstract = {The online usage of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) generates unlabeled
   data. This data in combination with the rich structure contained in BCI
   applications based on event-related potentials allow to design novel
   unsupervised classification approaches like learning from label
   proportions (LLP) or its combination with expectation-maximization (EM)
   into a mixed model. In this work, we explore the feasibility of
   unsupervised classification in a BCI chess application. We propose an
   LLP extension based on weighted least squares regression. It requires
   randomization of timing parameters but overcomes the dependency on
   additional symbols. Simulations on electroencephalogram data obtained
   from six subjects playing BCI-controlled chess show that a combination
   of unsupervised LLP with EM (despite not using any labels) by constant
   adaptation quickly reaches and on the long run outperforms the average
   performance level of non-adaptive supervised classifiers. With our
   contribution, we increase the scope for which unsupervised learning
   methods can successfully be applied in BCI.},

Title = {Versatile, modular 3D microelectrode arrays for neuronal ensemble
   recordings: from design to fabrication, assembly, and functional
   validation in non-human primates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective. Application-specific designs of electrode arrays offer an
   improved effectiveness for providing access to targeted brain regions in
   neuroscientific research and brain machine interfaces. The simultaneous
   and stable recording of neuronal ensembles is the main goal in the
   design of advanced neural interfaces. Here, we describe the development
   and assembly of highly customizable 3D microelectrode arrays and
   demonstrate their recording performance in chronic applications in
   non-human primates. Approach. System assembly relies on a
   microfabricated stacking component that is combined with Michigan-style
   silicon-based electrode arrays interfacing highly flexible polyimide
   cables. Based on the novel stacking component, the lead time for
   implementing prototypes with altered electrode pitches is minimal. Once
   the fabrication and assembly accuracy of the stacked probes have been
   characterized, their recording performance is assessed during in vivo
   chronic experiments in awake rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) trained to
   execute reaching-grasping motor tasks. Main results. Using a single set
   of fabrication tools, we implemented three variants of the stacking
   component for electrode distances of 250, 300 and 350 mu m in the
   stacking direction. We assembled neural probes with up to 96 channels
   and an electrode density of 98 electrodes mm(-2). Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that the shank alignment is accurate to a few mu m at an
   angular alignment better than 1 degrees. Three 64-channel probes were
   chronically implanted in two monkeys providing single-unit activity on
   more than 60\% of all channels and excellent recording stability.
   Histological tissue sections, obtained 52 d after implantation from one
   of the monkeys, showed minimal tissue damage, in accordance with the
   high quality and stability of the recorded neural activity.
   Significance. The versatility of our fabrication and assembly approach
   should significantly support the development of ideal interface
   geometries for a broad spectrum of applications. With the demonstrated
   performance, these probes are suitable for both semi-chronic and chronic
   applications.},

Title = {Dynamics of multiple interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations
   with delays},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {102},
Number = {2},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {A network consisting of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons is a
   canonical model for understanding local cortical network activity. In
   this study, we extended the local circuit model and investigated how its
   dynamical landscape can be enriched when it interacts with another
   excitatory (E) population with long transmission delays. Through
   analysis of a rate model and numerical simulations of a corresponding
   network of spiking neurons, we studied the transition from stationary to
   oscillatory states by analyzing the Hopf bifurcation structure in terms
   of two network parameters: (1) transmission delay between the EI
   subnetwork and the E population and (2) inhibitory couplings that
   induced oscillatory activity in the EI subnetwork. We found that the
   critical coupling strength can strongly modulate as a function of
   transmission delay, and consequently the stationary state can be
   interwoven intricately with the oscillatory state. Such a dynamical
   landscape gave rise to an isolated stationary state surrounded by
   multiple oscillatory states that generated different frequency modes,
   and cross-frequency coupling developed naturally at the bifurcation
   points. We identified the network motifs with short-and long-range
   inhibitory connections that underlie the emergence of oscillatory states
   with multiple frequencies. Thus, we provided a mechanistic explanation
   of how the transmission delay to and from the additional E population
   altered the dynamical landscape. In summary, our results demonstrated
   the potential role of long-range connections in shaping the network
   activity of local cortical circuits.},

Title = {Homeostatic control of synaptic rewiring in recurrent networks induces
   the formation of stable memory engrams},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Brain networks store new memories using functional and structural
   synaptic plasticity. Memory formation is generally attributed to Hebbian
   plasticity, while homeostatic plasticity is thought to have an ancillary
   role in stabilizing network dynamics. Here we report that homeostatic
   plasticity alone can also lead to the formation of stable memories. We
   analyze this phenomenon using a new theory of network remodeling,
   combined with numerical simulations of recurrent spiking neural networks
   that exhibit structural plasticity based on firing rate homeostasis.
   These networks are able to store repeatedly presented patterns and
   recall them upon the presentation of incomplete cues. Storage is fast,
   governed by the homeostatic drift. In contrast, forgetting is slow,
   driven by a diffusion process. Joint stimulation of neurons induces the
   growth of associative connections between them, leading to the formation
   of memory engrams. These memories are stored in a distributed fashion
   throughout connectivity matrix, and individual synaptic connections have
   only a small influence. Although memory-specific connections are
   increased in number, the total number of inputs and outputs of neurons
   undergo only small changes during stimulation. We find that homeostatic
   structural plasticity induces a specific type of ``silent memories{''},
   different from conventional attractor states.},

Abstract = {Objective. EEG artifacts of non-neural origin can be separated from
   neural signals by independent component analysis (ICA). It is unclear
   (1) how robustly recently proposed artifact classifiers transfer to
   novel users, novel paradigms or changed electrode setups, and (2) how
   artifact cleaning by a machine learning classifier impacts the
   performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Approach. Addressing
   (1), the robustness of different strategies with respect to the transfer
   between paradigms and electrode setups of a recently proposed classifier
   is investigated on offline data from 35 users and 3 EEG paradigms, which
   contain 6303 expert-labeled components from two ICA and preprocessing
   variants. Addressing (2), the effect of artifact removal on single-trial
   BCI classification is estimated on BCI trials from 101 users and 3
   paradigms. Main results. We show that (1) the proposed artifact
   classifier generalizes to completely different EEG paradigms. To obtain
   similar results under massively reduced electrode setups, a proposed
   novel strategy improves artifact classification. Addressing (2), ICA
   artifact cleaning has little influence on average BCI performance when
   analyzed by state-of-the-art BCI methods. When slow motor-related
   features are exploited, performance varies strongly between individuals,
   as artifacts may obstruct relevant neural activity or are inadvertently
   used for BCI control. Significance. Robustness of the proposed
   strategies can be reproduced by EEG practitioners as the method is made
   available as an EEGLAB plug-in.},

Title = {Dendritic inhibition differentially regulates excitability of dentate
   gyrus parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and granule cells},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVIs) and granule
   cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus receive layer-specific dendritic
   inhibition. Its impact on PVI and GC excitability is, however, unknown.
   By applying whole-cell recordings, GABA uncaging and
   single-cellmodeling, we show that proximal dendritic inhibition in PVIs
   is less efficient in lowering perforant path-mediated subthreshold
   depolarization than distal inhibition but both are highly efficient in
   silencing PVIs. These inhibitory effects can be explained by proximal
   shunting and distal strong hyperpolarizing inhibition. In contrast, GC
   proximal but not distal inhibition is the primary regulator of their
   excitability and recruitment. In GCs inhibition is hyperpolarizing along
   the entire somato-dendritic axis with similar strength. Thus, dendritic
   inhibition differentially controls input-output transformations in PVIs
   and GCs. Dendritic inhibition in PVIs is suited to balance PVI
   discharges in dependence on global network activity thereby providing
   strong and tuned perisomatic inhibition that contributes to the sparse
   representation of information in GC assemblies.},

Title = {From correlation to causation: Estimating effective connectivity from
   zero-lag covariances of brain signals},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Knowing brain connectivity is of great importance both in basic research
   and for clinical applications. We are proposing a method to infer
   directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity
   recorded at multiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations
   that are reflected in neuronal population activity. To derive our
   strategy, we assume a generic linear model of interacting continuous
   variables, the components of which represent the activity of local
   neuronal populations. The suggested method for inferring connectivity
   from recorded signals exploits the fact that the covariance matrix
   derived from the observed activity contains information about the
   existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a
   sparsely coupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal
   structure via L-1-minimization, which is known to prefer sparse
   solutions. In general, this method is suited to infer effective
   connectivity from resting state data of various types. We show that our
   method is applicable over a broad range of structural parameters
   regarding network size and connection probability of the network. We
   also explored parameters affecting its activity dynamics, like the
   eigenvalue spectrum. Also, based on the simulation of suitable
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to model BOLD dynamics, we show that with
   our method it is possible to estimate directed connectivity from
   zero-lag covariances derived from such signals. In this study, we
   consider measurement noise and unobserved nodes as additional
   confounding factors. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of data
   required for a reliable estimate. Additionally, we apply the proposed
   method on full-brain resting-state fast fMRI datasets. The resulting
   network exhibits a tendency for close-by areas being connected as well
   as inter-hemispheric connections between corresponding areas. In
   addition, we found that a surprisingly large fraction of more than one
   third of all identified connections were of inhibitory nature.},

Title = {Basal ganglia and cortical control of thalamic rebound spikes},

Abstract = {Movement-related decreases in firing rate have been observed in basal
   ganglia output neurons. They may transmit motor signals to the thalamus,
   but the effect of these firing rate decreases on downstream neurons in
   the motor thalamus is not known. One possibility is that they lead to
   thalamic post-inhibitory rebound spikes. However, it has also been
   argued that the physiological conditions permitting rebound spiking are
   pathological, and primarily present in Parkinson's disease. As in
   Parkinson's disease neural activity becomes pathologically correlated,
   we investigated the impact of correlations in basal ganglia output on
   the transmission of motor signals using a Hodgkin-Huxley model of
   thalamocortical neurons. We found that such correlations disrupt the
   transmission of motor signals via rebound spikes by decreasing the
   signal-to-noise ratio and increasing the trial-to-trial variability. We
   further examined the role of sensory responses in basal ganglia output
   neurons and the effect of cortical excitation of motor thalamus in
   modulating rebound spiking. Interestingly, both could either promote or
   suppress the generation of rebound spikes depending on their timing
   relative to the motor signal. Finally, we determined parameter regimes,
   such as levels of excitation, under which rebound spiking is feasible in
   the model, and confirmed that the conditions for rebound spiking are
   primarily given in pathological regimes. However, we also identified
   specific conditions in the model that would allow rebound spiking to
   occur in healthy animals in a small subset of thalamic neurons. Overall,
   our model provides novel insights into differences between normal and

Abstract = {Brief epochs of beta oscillations have been implicated in sensorimotor
   control in the basal ganglia of task-performing healthy animals.
   However, which neural processes underlie their generation and how they
   are affected by sensorimotor processing remains unclear. To determine
   the mechanisms underlying transient beta oscillations in the LFP, we
   combined computational modeling of the subthalamo-pallidal network for
   the generation of beta oscillations with realistic stimulation patterns
   derived from single-unit data recorded from different basal ganglia
   subregions in rats performing a cued choice task. In the recordings, we
   found distinct firing patterns in the striatum, globus pallidus, and
   subthalamic nucleus related to sensory and motor events during the
   behavioral task. Using these firing patterns to generate realistic
   inputs to our network model led to transient beta oscillations with the
   same time course as the rat LFP data. In addition, our model can account
   for further nonintuitive aspects of beta modulation, including beta
   phase resets after sensory cues and correlations with reaction time.
   Overall, our model can explain how the combination of temporally
   regulated sensory responses of the subthalamic nucleus, ramping activity
   of the subthalamic nucleus, and movement-related activity of the globus
   pallidus leads to transient beta oscillations during behavior.},

Title = {Organization of prefrontal network activity by respiration-related
   oscillations},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) integrates information from cortical
   and sub-cortical areas and contributes to the planning and initiation of
   behaviour. A potential mechanism for signal integration in the mPFC lies
   in the synchronization of neuronal discharges by theta (6-12 Hz)
   activity patterns. Here we show, using in vivo local field potential
   (LFP) and single-unit recordings from awake mice, that prominent
   oscillations in the sub-theta frequency band (1-5 Hz) emerge during
   awake immobility in the mPFC. These oscillation patterns are distinct
   from but phase-locked to hippocampal theta activity and occur
   synchronized with nasal respiration (hence termed prefrontal respiration
   rhythm {[}PRR]). PRR activity modulates the amplitude of prefrontal
   gamma rhythms with greater efficacy than theta oscillations.
   Furthermore, single-unit discharges of putative pyramidal cells and
   GABAergic interneurons are entrained by prefrontal PRR and nasal
   respiration. Our data thus suggest that PRR activity contributes to
   information processing in the prefrontal neuronal network.},

Abstract = {The loss and recovery of language functions are still incompletely
   understood. This longitudinal functional MRI study investigated the
   neural mechanisms underlying language recovery in patients with
   post-stroke aphasia putting particular emphasis on the impact of lesion
   site. To identify patterns of language-related activation, an auditory
   functional MRI sentence comprehension paradigm was administered to
   patients with circumscribed lesions of either left frontal (n = 17) or
   temporo-parietal (n = 17) cortex. Patients were examined repeatedly
   during the acute (<= 1 week, t1), subacute (1-2 weeks, t2) and chronic
   phase (>6 months, t3) poststroke; healthy age-matched control subjects
   (n = 17) were tested once. The separation into two patient groups with
   circumscribed lesions allowed for a direct comparison of the
   contributions of distinct lesion-dependent network components to
   language reorganization between both groups. We hypothesized that
   activation of left hemisphere spared and perilesional cortex as well as
   lesion-homologue cortex in the right hemisphere varies between patient
   groups and across time. In addition, we expected that domain-general
   networks serving cognitive control independently contribute to language
   recovery. First, we found a global network disturbance in the acute
   phase that is characterized by reduced functional MRI language
   activation including areas distant to the lesion (i.e. diaschisis) and
   subsequent subacute network reactivation (i.e. resolution of
   diaschisis). These phenomena were driven by temporo-parietal lesions.
   Second, we identified a lesion-independent sequential activation pattern
   with increased activity of perilesional cortex and bilateral
   domain-general networks in the subacute phase followed by reorganization
   of left temporal language areas in the chronic phase. Third, we observed
   involvement of lesion-homologue cortex only in patients with frontal but
   not temporo-parietal lesions. Fourth, irrespective of lesion location,
   language reorganization predominantly occurred in pre-existing networks
   showing comparable activation in healthy controls. Finally, we detected
   different relationships of performance and activation in language and
   domain-general networks demonstrating the functional relevance for
   language recovery. Our findings highlight that the dynamics of language
   reorganization clearly depend on lesion location and hence open new
   perspectives for neurobiologically motivated strategies of language
   rehabilitation, such as individually-tailored targeted application of
   neurostimulation.},

Title = {Low-frequency electrical stimulation reduces cortical excitability in
   the human brain},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Abstract = {Effective seizure control remains challenging for about 30\% of epilepsy
   patients who are resistant to present-day pharmacotherapy. Novel
   approaches that not only reduce the severity and frequency of seizures,
   but also have limited side effects are therefore desirable. Accordingly,
   various neuromodulation approaches such as cortical electrical
   stimulation have been implemented to reduce seizure burden; however, the
   underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Given that the
   initiation and spread of epileptic seizures critically depend on
   cortical excitability, understanding the neuromodulatory effects of
   cortical electrical stimulation on cortical excitability levels is
   paramount. Based on observations that synchronization in the
   electrocorticogram closely tracks brain excitability level, the effects
   of low-frequency (1 Hz) intracranial brain stimulation on the levels of
   cortical phase synchronization before, during, and after 1 Hz electrical
   stimulation were assessed in twelve patients. Analysis of phase
   synchronization levels across three broad frequency bands (1-45 Hz,
   55-95 Hz, and 105-195 Hz) revealed that in patients with stimulation
   sites in the neocortex, phase synchronization levels were significantly
   reduced within the 55-95 Hz and 105-195 Hz bands during post-stimulation
   intervals compared to baseline; this effect persisted for at least 30
   min post-stimulation. Similar effects were observed when phase
   synchronization levels were examined in the classic frequency bands,
   whereby a significant reduction was found during the post-stimulation
   intervals in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands. The anatomical extent of
   these effects was then assessed. Analysis of the results from six
   patients with intracranial electrodes in both hemispheres indicated that
   reductions in phase synchronization in the 1-45 Hz and 55-95 Hz
   frequency ranges were more prominent in the stimulated hemisphere.
   Overall, these findings demonstrate that low-frequency electrical
   stimulation reduces phase synchronization and hence cortical
   excitability in the human brain. Low-frequency stimulation of the
   epileptic focus may therefore contribute to the prevention of impending
   epileptic seizures.},

Abstract = {The success of machine learning in a broad range of applications has led
   to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used
   off the shelf by non-experts. To be effective in practice, such systems
   need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing
   steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set their respective
   hyperparameters. Recent work has started to tackle this automated
   machine learning (AutoML) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian
   optimization methods. Building on this, we introduce a robust new AutoML
   system based on scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers, 14 feature
   preprocessing methods, and 4 data preprocessing methods, giving rise to
   a structured hypothesis space with 110 hyperparameters). This system,
   which we dub AUTO-SKLEARN, improves on existing AutoML methods by
   automatically taking into account past performance on similar datasets,
   and by constructing ensembles from the models evaluated during the
   optimization. Our system won the first phase of the ongoing ChaLearn
   AutoML challenge, and our comprehensive analysis on over 100 diverse
   datasets shows that it substantially outperforms the previous state of
   the art in AutoML. We also demonstrate the performance gains due to each
   of our contributions and derive insights into the effectiveness of the

Title = {Unilateral transfemoral amputees exhibit altered strength and dynamics

Abstract = {Objective. Somatosensory perception is disrupted in patients with a
   lower limb amputation. This increases the difficulty to maintain balance
   and leads to the development of neuromuscular adjustments. We
   investigated how these adjustments are reflected in the co-activation of
   lower body muscles and are modulated by visual feedback. Approach. We
   measured electromyography (EMG) signals of muscles from the trunk
   (erector spinae and obliquus external), and the lower intact/dominant
   leg (tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius) in 11 unilateral
   transfemoral amputees and 11 age-matched able-bodied controls during 30
   s of upright standing with and without visual feedback. Muscle synergies
   involved in balance control were investigated using wavelet coherence
   analysis. We focused on seven frequencies grouped in three frequency
   bands, a low-frequency band (7.56 and 19.86 Hz) representing more
   sub-cortical and spinal inputs to the muscles, a mid-frequency band
   (38.26 and 62.63 Hz) representing more cortical inputs, and a
   high-frequency band (92.90, 129 and 170.90 Hz) associated with
   synchronizing motor unit action potentials. Further, the dynamics of
   changes in intermuscular coupling over time were quantified using the
   Entropic Half-Life. Main results. Amputees exhibited lower coherency
   values when vision was removed at 7.56 Hz for the muscle pair of the
   lower leg. At this frequency, the coherency values of the amputee group
   also differed from controls for the eyes closed condition. Controls and
   amputees exhibited opposite coherent behaviors with visual feedback at
   7.56 Hz. For the eyes open condition at 129 Hz, the coherency values of
   amputees and controls differed for the muscle pair of the trunk, and at
   170.90 Hz for the muscle pair of the lower leg. Amputees exhibited
   different dynamics of muscle co-activation at the low frequency band
   when vision was available. Significance. Altogether, these findings
   point to the development of neuromuscular adaptations reflected in the
   strength and dynamics of muscular co-activation.},

Title = {Bioelectronic microfluidic wound healing: a platform for investigating

Abstract = {Upon cutaneous injury, the human body naturally forms an electric field
   (EF) that acts as a guidance cue for relevant cellular and tissue repair
   and reorganization. However, the direct current (DC) flow imparted by
   this EF can be impacted by a variety of diseases. This work delves into
   the impact of DC stimulation on both healthy and diabetic in vitro wound
   healing models of human keratinocytes, the most prevalent cell type of
   the skin. The culmination of non-metal electrode materials and prudent
   microfluidic design allowed us to create a compact bioelectronic
   platform to study the effects of different sustained (12 hours
   galvanostatic DC) EF configurations on wound closure dynamics.
   Specifically, we compared if electrotactically closing a wound's gap
   from one wound edge (i.e., uni-directional EF) is as effective as
   compared to alternatingly polarizing both the wound's edges (i.e.,
   pseudo-converging EF) as both of these spatial stimulation strategies
   are fundamental to the eventual translational electrode design and
   strategy. We found that uni-directional electric guidance cues were
   superior in group keratinocyte healing dynamics by enhancing the wound
   closure rate nearly three-fold for both healthy and diabetic-like
   keratinocyte collectives, compared to their non-stimulated respective
   controls. The motility-inhibited and diabetic-like keratinocytes
   regained wound closure rates with uni-directional electrical stimulation
   (increase from 1.0 to 2.8\% h(-1)) comparable to their healthy
   non-stimulated keratinocyte counterparts (3.5\% h(-1)). Our results
   bring hope that electrical stimulation delivered in a controlled manner
   can be a viable pathway to accelerate wound repair, and also by
   providing a baseline for other researchers trying to find an optimal
   electrode blueprint for in vivo DC stimulation.},

   Schmidt-numbers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {144},
Number = {24},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {We present an efficient mesoscale model to simulate the diffusion
   measurement with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). On the level of
   mesoscopic thermal motion of fluid particles, we couple the Bloch
   equations with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). Thereby we establish
   a physically consistent scaling relation between the diffusion constant
   measured for DPD-particles and the diffusion constant of a real fluid.
   The latter is based on a splitting into a centre-of-mass contribution
   represented by DPD, and an internal contribution which is not resolved
   in the DPD-level of description. As a consequence, simulating the
   centre-of-mass contribution with DPD requires high Schmidt numbers.
   After a verification for fundamental pulse sequences, we apply the
   NMR-DPD method to NMR diffusion measurements of anisotropic fluids, and
   of fluids restricted by walls of microfluidic channels. For the latter,
   the free diffusion and the localisation regime are considered. Published

Abstract = {Respiratory brain pulsations have recently been shown to drive
   electrophysiological brain activity in patients with epilepsy.
   Furthermore, functional neuroimaging indicates that respiratory brain
   pulsations have increased variability and amplitude in patients with
   epilepsy compared to healthy individuals. To determine whether the
   respiratory drive is altered in epilepsy, we compared respiratory brain
   pulsation synchronicity between healthy controls and patients. Whole
   brain fast functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 40
   medicated patients with focal epilepsy, 20 drug-naive patients and 102
   healthy controls. Cerebrospinal fluid associated respiratory pulsations
   were used to generate individual whole brain respiratory synchronization
   maps, which were compared between groups. Finally, we analyzed the
   seizure frequency effect and diagnostic accuracy of the respiratory
   synchronization defect in epilepsy. Respiratory brain pulsations related
   to the verified fourth ventricle pulsations were significantly more
   synchronous in patients in frontal, periventricular and mid-temporal
   regions, while the seizure frequency correlated positively with
   synchronicity. The respiratory brain synchronicity had a good diagnostic
   accuracy (ROCAUC = 0.75) in discriminating controls from medicated
   patients. The elevated respiratory brain synchronicity in focal epilepsy
   suggests altered physiological effect of cerebrospinal fluid pulsations
   possibly linked to regional brain water dynamics involved with
   interictal brain physiology.},

Abstract = {We study motion planning problems where agents move inside environments
   that are not fully observable and subject to uncertainties. The goal is
   to compute a strategy for an agent that is guaranteed to satisfy certain
   safety and performance specifications. Such problems are naturally
   modeled by partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).
   Because of the potentially huge or even infinite belief space of POMDPs,
   verification and strategy synthesis is in general computationally
   intractable. We tackle this difficulty by exploiting typical structural
   properties of such scenarios; for instance, we assume that agents have
   the ability to observe their own positions inside an environment.
   Ambiguity in the state of the environment is abstracted into
   non-deterministic choices over the possible states of the environment.
   Technically, this abstraction transforms POMDPs into probabilistic
   two-player games (PGs). For these PGs, efficient verification tools are
   able to determine strategies that approximate certain measures on the
   POMDP. If an approximation is too coarse to provide guarantees, an
   abstraction refinement scheme further resolves the belief space of the
   POMDP. We demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art by
   orders of magnitude compared to a direct solution of the POMDP.},

Abstract = {Electroencephalogram data used in the domain of brain-computer
   interfaces typically has subpar signal-to-noise ratio and data
   acquisition is expensive. An effective and commonly used classifier to
   discriminate event-related potentials is the linear discriminant
   analysis which, however, requires an estimate of the feature
   distribution. While this information is provided by the feature
   covariance matrix its large number of free parameters calls for
   regularization approaches like Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage. Assuming that the
   noise of event-related potential recordings is not time-locked, we
   propose to decouple the time component from the covariance matrix of
   event-related potential data in order to further improve the estimates
   of the covariance matrix for linear discriminant analysis. We compare
   three regularized variants thereof and a feature representation based on
   Riemannian geometry against our proposed novel linear discriminant
   analysis with time-decoupled covariance estimates. Extensive evaluations
   on 14 electroencephalogram datasets reveal, that the novel approach
   increases the classification performance by up to four percentage points
   for small training datasets, and gracefully converges to the performance
   of standard shrinkage-regularized LDA for large training datasets. Given
   these results, practitioners in this field should consider using our
   proposed time-decoupled covariance estimation when they apply linear
   discriminant analysis to classify event-related potentials, especially
   when few training data points are available.},

Abstract = {In this letter, we deal with the reality gap from a novel perspective,
   targeting transferring deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies
   learned in simulated environments to the real-world domain for visual
   control tasks. Instead of adopting the common solutions to the problem
   by increasing the visual fidelity of synthetic images output from
   simulators during the training phase, we seek to tackle the problem by
   translating the real-world image streams back to the synthetic domain
   during the deployment phase, to make the robot feel at home. We propose
   this as a lightweight, flexible, and efficient solution for visual
   control, as first, no extra transfer steps are required during the
   expensive training of DRL agents in simulation; second, the trained DRL
   agents will not be constrained to being deployable in only one specific
   real-world environment; and third, the policy training and the transfer
   operations are decoupled, and can be conducted in parallel. Besides
   this, we propose a simple yet effective shift loss that is agnostic to
   the downstream task, to constrain the consistency between subsequent
   frames which is important for consistent policy outputs. We validate the
   shift loss for artistic style transfer for videos and domain adaptation,
   and validate our visual control approach in indoor and outdoor robotics
   experiments.},

Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},

Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {There is a growing interest in developing novel brain stimulation
   methods to control disease-related aberrant neural activity and to
   address basic neuroscience questions. Conventional methods for
   manipulating brain activity rely on open-loop approaches that usually
   lead to excessive stimulation and, crucially, do not restore the
   original computations performed by the network. Thus, they are often
   accompanied by undesired side-effects. Here, we introduce delayed
   feedback control (DFC), a conceptually simple but effective method, to
   control pathological oscillations in spiking neural networks (SNNs).
   Using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations we show that DFC
   can restore a wide range of aberrant network dynamics either by
   suppressing or enhancing synchronous irregular activity. Importantly,
   DFC, besides steering the system back to a healthy state, also recovers
   the computations performed by the underlying network. Finally, using our
   theory we identify the role of single neuron and synapse properties in
   determining the stability of the closed-loop system.},

Abstract = {Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by focal, recurrent
   spontaneous seizures, sclerosis and granule cell dispersion (GCD) in the
   hippocampal formation. Changes in theta rhythm properties have been
   correlated with the severity of hippocampal restructuring and were
   suggested as a cause of memory deficits accompanying epilepsy. For
   severe sclerosis, it has even been questioned whether theta band
   oscillations persist. We asked how theta oscillations change with graded
   restructuring along the longitudinal hippocampal axis and whether these
   changes correlate with the overall severity of temporal lobe epilepsy.
   We recorded local field potentials in the medial entorhinal cortex and
   along the septo-temporal axis of the dentate gyrus at sites with
   different degrees of GCD in freely behaving epileptic mice. Theta
   frequency was decreased at all recording positions throughout the
   dentate gyrus and in the medial entorhinal cortex, irrespective of the
   extent of GCD or the rate of severe epileptic events. The frequency
   reduction by up to 1.7 Hz, corresponding to 1/3 octaves within the theta
   range, was present during rest, exploration and running. Despite the
   frequency reduction, theta oscillations remained coherent across the
   hippocampal formation and were modulated by running speed as in
   controls. The reduction in theta frequency thus is likely not a
   consequence of the local restructuring but rather a global phenomenon
   affecting the hippocampal formation as a whole.},

   during a calibration recording, in which the user is asked to perform a
   specific task. Based on the known labels of this recording, the BCI's
   classifier can learn to decode the individual's brain signals.
   Unfortunately, this calibration recording consumes valuable time.
   Furthermore, it is unproductive with respect to the final BCI
   application, e. g. text entry. Therefore, the calibration period must be
   reduced to a minimum, which is especially important for patients with a
   limited concentration ability. The main contribution of this manuscript
   is an online study on unsupervised learning in an auditory event-related
   potential (ERP) paradigm. Our results demonstrate that the calibration
   recording can be bypassed by utilizing an unsupervised trained
   classifier, that is initialized randomly and updated during usage.
   Initially, the unsupervised classifier tends to make decoding mistakes,
   as the classifier might not have seen enough data to build a reliable
   model. Using a constant re-analysis of the previously spelled symbols,
   these initially misspelled symbols can be rectified posthoc when the
   classifier has learned to decode the signals. We compare the spelling
   performance of our unsupervised approach and of the unsupervised posthoc
   approach to the standard supervised calibration-based dogma for n = 10
   healthy users. To assess the learning behavior of our approach, it is
   unsupervised trained from scratch three times per user. Even with the
   relatively low SNR of an auditory ERP paradigm, the results show that
   after a limited number of trials (30 trials), the unsupervised approach
   performs comparably to a classic supervised model.},

Abstract = {Optogenetics has revolutionized neurobiological research by allowing to
   disentangle intricate neuronal circuits at a spatiotemporal precision
   unmatched by other techniques. Here, we review current advances of
   optogenetic applications in mammals, especially focusing on freely
   moving animals. State-of-the-art strategies allow the targeted
   expression of opsins in neuronal subpopulations, defined either by
   genetic cell type or neuronal projection pattern. Optogenetic
   manipulations of these subpopulations become particularly powerful when
   combined with behavioral paradigms and neurophysiological readout
   techniques. Thereby, specific roles can be assigned to identified cells.
   All-optical approaches with the opportunity to write complex three
   dimensional patterns into neuronal networks have recently emerged. While
   clinical implications of the new tool set seem tempting, we emphasize
   here the role of optogenetics for basic research.},

Abstract = {Three- and four-dimensional imaging techniques are a prerequisite for
   spatially resolving the form-structure-function relationships in plants.
   However, choosing the right imaging method is a difficult and
   time-consuming process as the imaging principles, advantages and
   limitations, as well as the appropriate fields of application first need
   to be compared. The present study aims to provide an overview of three
   imaging methods that allow for imaging opaque, large and thick (>5 mm,
   up to several centimeters), hierarchically organized plant samples that
   can have complex geometries. We compare light microscopy of serial thin
   sections followed by 3D reconstruction (LMTS3D) as an optical imaging
   technique, micro-computed tomography (mu-CT) based on ionizing
   radiation, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which uses the natural
   magnetic properties of a sample for image acquisition. We discuss the
   most important imaging principles, advantages, and limitations, and
   suggest fields of application for each imaging technique (LMTS, mu-CT,
   and MRI) with regard to static (at a given time; 3D) and dynamic (at
   different time points; quasi 4D) structural and functional plant
   imaging.},

Title = {Dynamics of Competition between Subnetworks of Spiking Neuronal Networks
   in the Balanced State},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {We explore and analyze the nonlinear switching dynamics of neuronal
   networks with non-homogeneous connectivity. The general significance of
   such transient dynamics for brain function is unclear; however, for
   instance decision-making processes in perception and cognition have been
   implicated with it. The network under study here is comprised of three
   subnetworks of either excitatory or inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire
   neurons, of which two are of the same type. The synaptic weights are
   arranged to establish and maintain a balance between excitation and
   inhibition in case of a constant external drive. Each subnetwork is
   randomly connected, where all neurons belonging to a particular
   population have the same in-degree and the same out-degree. Neurons in
   different subnetworks are also randomly connected with the same
   probability; however, depending on the type of the pre-synaptic neuron,
   the synaptic weight is scaled by a factor. We observed that for a
   certain range of the ``within{''} versus ``between{''} connection
   weights (bifurcation parameter), the network activation spontaneously
   switches between the two sub-networks of the same type. This kind of
   dynamics has been termed ``winnerless competition{''}, which also has a
   random component here. In our model, this phenomenon is well described
   by a set of coupled stochastic differential equations of Lotka-Volterra
   type that imply a competition between the subnetworks. The associated
   mean-field model shows the same dynamical behavior as observed in
   simulations of large networks comprising thousands of spiking neurons.
   The deterministic phase portrait is characterized by two attractors and
   a saddle node, its stochastic component is essentially given by the
   multiplicative inherent noise of the system. We find that the dwell time
   distribution of the active states is exponential, indicating that the
   noise drives the system randomly from one attractor to the other. A
   similar model for a larger number of populations might suggest a general
   approach to study the dynamics of interacting populations of spiking
   networks.},

Abstract = {Robot motions in the presence of humans should not only be feasible and
   safe, but also conform to human preferences. This, however, requires
   user feedback on the robot's behavior. In this work, we propose a novel
   approach to leverage the user's brain signals as a feedback modality in
   order to decode the judgment of robot trajectories and rank them
   according to the user's preferences. We show that brain signals measured
   using electroencephalography during observation of a robotic arm's
   trajectory as well as in response to preference statements are
   informative regarding the user's target trajectory. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that user feedback from brain signals can be used to
   reliably infer pairwise trajectory preferences as well as to retrieve
   the target trajectories of the user with a performance comparable to
   explicit behavioral feedback.},

Abstract = {Neural probes are sophisticated electrophysiological tools used for
   intra-cortical recording and stimulation. These microelectrode arrays,
   designed to penetrate and interface the brain from within, contribute at
   the forefront of basic and clinical neuroscience. However, one of the
   challenges and currently most significant limitations is their
   `seamless' long-term integration into the surrounding brain tissue.
   Following implantation, which is typically accompanied by bleeding, the
   tissue responds with a scarring process, resulting in a gliotic region
   closest to the probe. This glial scarring is often associated with
   neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and a leaky blood-brain interface
   (BBI). The engineering progress on minimizing this reaction in the form
   of improved materials, microfabrication, and surgical techniques is
   summarized in this review. As research over the past decade has
   progressed towards a more detailed understanding of the nature of this
   biological response, it is time to pose the question: Are penetrating
   probes completely free from glial scarring at all possible?},

Title = {Intracortical probe arrays with silicon backbone and microelectrodes on

Abstract = {Objective. Recording and stimulating neuronal activity across different
   brain regions requires interfacing at multiple sites using dedicated
   tools while tissue reactions at the recording sites often prevent their
   successful long-term application. This implies the technological
   challenge of developing complex probe geometries while keeping the
   overall footprint minimal, and of selecting materials compatible with
   neural tissue. While the potential of soft materials in reducing tissue
   response is uncontested, the implantation of these materials is often
   limited to reliably target neuronal structures across large brain
   volumes. Approach. We report on the development of a new multi-electrode
   array exploiting the advantages of soft and stiff materials by combining
   7-mu m-thin polyimide wings carrying platinum electrodes with a silicon
   backbone enabling a safe probe implantation. The probe fabrication
   applies microsystems technologies in combination with a temporal wafer
   fixation method for rear side processing, i.e. grinding and deep
   reactive ion etching, of slender probe shanks and electrode wings. The
   wing-type neural probes are chronically implanted into the
   entorhinal-hippocampal formation in the mouse for in vivo recordings of
   freely behaving animals. Main results. Probes comprising the novel
   wing-type electrodes have been realized and characterized in view of
   their electrical performance and insertion capability. Chronic
   electrophysiological in vivo recordings of the entorhinal-hippocampal
   network in the mouse of up to 104 days demonstrated a stable yield of
   channels containing identifiable multi-unit and single-unit activity
   outperforming probes with electrodes residing on a Si backbone.
   Significance. The innovative fabrication process using a process
   compatible, temporary wafer bonding allowed to realize new
   Michigan-style probe arrays. The wing-type probe design enables a
   precise probe insertion into brain tissue and long-term stable
   recordings of unit activity due to the application of a stable backbone
   and 7-mu m-thin probe wings provoking locally a minimal tissue response
   and protruding from the glial scare of the backbone.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {345},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The vertebrate brain comprises a plethora of cell types connected by
   intertwined pathways. Optogenetics enriches the neuroscientific tool set
   for disentangling these neuronal circuits in a manner which exceeds the
   spatiotemporal precision of previously existing techniques. Technically,
   optogenetics can be divided in three types of optical and genetic
   combinations: (1) it is primarily understood as the manipulation of the
   activity of genetically modified cells (typically neurons) with light,
   i.e. optical actuators. (2) A second combination refers to visualizing
   the activity of genetically modified cells (again typically neurons),
   i.e. optical sensors. (3) A completely different interpretation of
   optogenetics refers to the light activated expression of a genetically
   induced construct. Here, we focus on the first two types of
   optogenetics, i.e. the optical actuators and sensors in an attempt to
   give an overview into the topic. We first cover methods to express
   opsins into neurons and introduce strategies of targeting specific
   neuronal populations in different animal species. We then summarize
   combinations of optogenetics with behavioral read out and neuronal
   imaging. Finally, we give an overview of the current state-of-the-art
   and an outlook on future perspectives.},

Abstract = {We present two piezo-actuated adaptive prisms with apertures of 8 mm
   based on a bi-axial continuously tiltable glass window on top of an
   optical fluid, enabling fast scanning applications in a compact, linear
   axial design. One prism with a device size of 58 by 51 mm is optimized
   for scan angles of +/- 6.4 degrees and response times of 2.5 ms. A
   second compact prism uses spiral-shaped actuators to achieve a reduced
   device diameter of 33 mm at slightly compromised maximum scan angles of
   +/- 4.0 degrees with response times of approximately 4 ms. We show the
   design and FEM-based optimization of the prisms, their fabrication and
   the characterization of the scan angles and of the dynamic behavior.
   Finally, we also demonstrate the linearity of the system and discuss a
   simple control model.},

Abstract = {Visual neglect results from dysfunction within the spatial attention
   network. The structural connectivity in undamaged brain tissue in
   neglect has barely been investigated until now. In the present study, we
   explored the microstructural white matter characteristics of the
   contralesional hemisphere in relation to neglect severity and recovery
   in acute stroke patients. We compared age-matched healthy subjects and
   three groups of acute stroke patients (9 +/- 0.5 days after stroke): (i)
   patients with nonrecovered neglect (n = 12); (ii) patients with rapid
   recovery from initial neglect (within the first week post-stroke, n =
   7), (iii) stroke patients without neglect (n = 17). We analyzed the
   differences between groups in grey and white matter density and
   fractional anisotropy (FA) and used fiber tracking to identify the
   affected fibers. Patients with nonrecovered neglect differed from those
   with rapid recovery by FA-reduction in the left inferior parietal lobe.
   Fibers passing through this region connect the left-hemispheric
   analogues of the ventral attention system. Compared with healthy
   subjects, neglect patients with persisting neglect had FA-reduction in
   the left superior parietal lobe, optic radiation, and left corpus
   callosum/cingulum. Fibers passing through these regions connect centers
   of the left dorsal attention system. FA-reduction in the identified
   regions correlated with neglect severity. The study shows for the first
   time white matter changes within the spatial attention system remote
   from the lesion and correlating with the extent and persistence of
   neglect. The data support the concept of neglect as disintegration
   within the whole attention system and illustrate the dynamics of
   structural-functional correlates in acute stroke. (C) 2014 Wiley

Title = {Concordance of Epileptic Networks Associated with Epileptic Spikes
   Measured by High-Density EEG and Fast fMRI},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {Objective
   The present study aims to investigate whether a newly developed fast
   fMRI called MREG (magnetic resonance encephalography) measures metabolic
   changes related to interictal epileptic discharges (IED). For this
   purpose BOLD changes are correlated with the IED distribution and
   variability.
   Methods
   Patients with focal epilepsy underwent EEG-MREG using a 64 channel cap.
   IED voltage maps were generated using 32 and 64 channels and compared
   regarding their correspondence to the BOLD response. The extents of IEDs
   (defined as number of channels with >50\% of maximum IED negativity)
   were correlated with the extents of positive and negative BOLD
   responses. Differences in inter-spike variability were investigated
   between interictal epileptic discharges (IED) sets with and without
   concordant positive or negative BOLD responses.
   Results
   17 patients showed 32 separate IED types. In 50\% of IED types the BOLD
   changes could be confirmed by another independent imaging method. The
   IED extent significantly correlated with the positive BOLD extent (p =
   0.04). In 6 patients the 64-channel EEG voltage maps better reflected
   the positive or negative BOLD response than the 32-channel EEG; in all
   others no difference was seen. Inter-spike variability was significantly
   lower in IED sets with than without concordant positive or negative BOLD
   responses (with p = 0.04).
   Significance
   Higher density EEG and fast fMRI seem to improve the value of EEG-fMRI
   in epilepsy. The correlation of positive BOLD and IED extent could
   suggest that widespread BOLD responses reflect the IED network.
   Inter-spike variability influences the likelihood to find IED concordant
   positive or negative BOLD responses, which is why single IED analysis
   may be promising.},

Abstract = {Attention-based brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms offer a way to
   exert control, but also to provide insight into a user's perception and
   judgment of the environment. For a sufficient classification
   performance, user engagement and motivation are critical aspects.
   Consequently, many paradigms require the user to perform an auxiliary
   task, such as mentally counting subsets of stimuli or pressing a button
   when encountering them. In this work, we compare two user tasks, mental
   counting and button-presses, in a hazard detection paradigm in driving
   videos. We find that binary classification performance of events based
   on the electroencephalogram as well as user preference are higher for
   button presses. Amplitudes of evoked responses are higher for the
   counting task an observation which holds even after projecting out
   motor-related potentials during the data preprocessing. Our results
   indicate that the choice of button-presses can be a preferable choice in
   such BCIs based on prediction performance as well as user preference.},

Abstract = {Data-driven spatial filtering algorithms optimize scores, such as the
   contrast between two conditions to extract oscillatory brain signal
   components. Most machine learning approaches for the filter estimation,
   however, disregard within-trial temporal dynamics and are extremely
   sensitive to changes in training data and involved hyperparameters. This
   leads to highly variable solutions and impedes the selection of a
   suitable candidate for, e.g., neurotechnological applications. Fostering
   component introspection, we propose to embrace this variability by
   condensing the functional signatures of a large set of oscillatory
   components into homogeneous clusters, each representing specific
   within-trial envelope dynamics. The proposed method is exemplified by
   and evaluated on a complex hand force task with a rich within-trial
   structure. Based on electroencephalography data of 18 healthy subjects,
   we found that the components' distinct temporal envelope dynamics are
   highly subject-specific. On average, we obtained seven clusters per
   subject, which were strictly confinedregarding their underlying
   frequencybands. As the analysis method is not limited to a specific
   spatial filtering algorithm, it could be utilized for a wide range of
   neurotechnological applications, e.g., to select and monitor
   functionally relevant features for brain-computer interface protocols in
   stroke rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {The time between the onset of subsequent auditory or visual stimuli -
   also known as stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) - determines many of the
   event-related potential characteristics of the resulting evoked brain
   signals. Specifically, the SOA value influences the performance of an
   individual subject in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications like
   spellers. In the past, subject-specific optimization of the SOA was
   rarely considered in BCI studies. Our research strives to reduce the
   time requirements of individual BCI stimulus parameter optimization.
   This work contributes to this goal in two ways. First, we show that even
   the classification performance on extremely reduced training data
   subsets reveals the influence of SOA. Second, we show, that these noisy
   estimates are sufficient to make decisions for individual choices of the
   SOA that transfer to good classification performance on large training
   data sets. Thus our work contributes to individually tailored SOA
   selection procedures for BCI users.},

Abstract = {We introduce STOUT (spatio-temporal unifying tomography), a novel method
   for the source analysis of electroencephalograpic (EEG) recordings,
   which is based on a physiologically-motivated source representation. Our
   method assumes that only a small number of brain sources are active
   throughout a measurement, where each of the sources exhibits focal
   (smooth but localized) characteristics in space, time and frequency.
   This structure is enforced through an expansion of the source current
   density into appropriate spatio-temporal basis functions in combination
   with sparsity constraints. This approach combines the main strengths of
   two existing methods, namely Sparse Basis Field Expansions (Haufe et
   al., 2011) and Time-Frequency Mixed-Norm Estimates (Gramfort et al.,
   2013). By adjusting the ratio between two regularization terms, STOUT is
   capable of trading temporal for spatial reconstruction accuracy and vice
   versa, depending on the requirements of specific analyses and the
   provided data. Due to allowing for non-stationary source activations,
   STOUT is particularly suited for the localization of event-related
   potentials (ERP) and other evoked brain activity. We demonstrate its
   performance on simulated ERP data for varying signal-to-noise ratios and
   numbers of active sources. Our analysis of the generators of visual and
   auditory evoked N200 potentials reveals that the most active sources
   originate in the temporal and occipital lobes, in line with the
   literature on sensory processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Objective. Most BCIs have to undergo a calibration session in which data
   is recorded to train decoders with machine learning. Only recently
   zero-training methods have become a subject of study. This work proposes
   a probabilistic framework for BCI applications which exploit
   event-related potentials (ERPs). For the example of a visual P300
   speller we show how the framework harvests the structure suitable to
   solve the decoding task by (a) transfer learning, (b) unsupervised
   adaptation, (c) language model and (d) dynamic stopping. Approach. A
   simulation study compares the proposed probabilistic zero framework
   (using transfer learning and task structure) to a state-of-the-art
   supervised model on n = 22 subjects. The individual influence of the
   involved components (a)-(d) are investigated. Main results. Without any
   need for a calibration session, the probabilistic zero-training
   framework with inter-subject transfer learning shows excellent
   performance-competitive to a state-of-the-art supervised method using
   calibration. Its decoding quality is carried mainly by the effect of
   transfer learning in combination with continuous unsupervised
   adaptation. Significance. A high-performing zero-training BCI is within
   reach for one of the most popular BCI paradigms: ERP spelling. Recording
   calibration data for a supervised BCI would require valuable time which
   is lost for spelling. The time spent on calibration would allow a novel
   user to spell 29 symbols with our unsupervised approach. It could be of
   use for various clinical and non-clinical ERP-applications of BCI.},

Abstract = {Hippocampal principal cell (PC) assemblies provide the brain with a
   mnemonic representation of space. It is assumed that the formation of
   cell assemblies is supported by long-lasting modification of
   glutamatergic synapses onto perisomatic inhibitory interneurons (PIIs),
   which provide powerful feedback inhibition to neuronal networks.
   Repetitive activation of dentate gyrus PIIs by excitatory mossy fiber
   (MF) inputs induces Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP). In contrast,
   long-term depression (LTD) emerges in the absence of PII activity.
   However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying
   synaptic plasticity in PIIs. Here, we examined the role of group I
   metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (mGluRs1/5) in inducing plastic
   changes at MF-PII synapses. We found that mGluRs1/5 are located
   perisynaptically and that pharmacological block of mGluR1 or mGluR5
   abolished MF-LTP. In contrast, their exogenous activation was
   insufficient to induce MF-LTP but cleared MF-LTD. No LTP could be
   elicited in PIIs loaded with blockers of G protein signaling and
   Ca2+-dependent PKC. Two-photon imaging revealed that the intracellular
   Ca2+ rise necessary for MF-LTP was largely mediated by Ca2+-permeable
   AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs), but less by NMDA receptors or mGluRs1/5.
   Thus, our data indicate that fast Ca2+ signaling via CP-AMPARs and slow
   G protein-mediated signaling via mGluRs1/5 converge to a PKC-dependent

Title = {Neuronal Growth and Behavioral Alterations in Mice Deficient for the
   Psychiatric Disease-Associated Negr1 Gene},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1), a member of the immunoglobulin
   superfamily cell adhesion molecule subgroup IgLON, has been implicated
   in neuronal growth and connectivity. In addition, genetic variants in or
   near the NEGR1 locus have been associated with obesity and more recently
   with learning difficulties, intellectual disability and psychiatric
   disorders. However, experimental evidence is lacking to support a
   possible link between NEGR1, neuronal growth and behavioral
   abnormalities. Initial expression analysis of NEGR1 mRNA in C57Bl/6
   wildtype (WT) mice by in situ hybridization demonstrated marked
   expression in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and dentate granule cells. In
   co-cultures of cortical neurons and NSC-34 cells overexpressing NEGR1,
   neurite growth of cortical neurons was enhanced and distal axons
   occupied an increased area of cells overexpressing NEGR1. Conversely, in
   organotypic slice co-cultures, Negr1-knockout (KO) hippocampus was less
   permissive for axons grown from EC of beta-actin-enhanced green
   fluorescent protein (EGFP) mice compared to WT hippocampus.
   Neuroanatomical analysis revealed abnormalities of EC axons in the
   hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of Negr1-KO mice including increased
   numbers of axonal projections to the hilus. Neurotransmitter receptor
   ligand binding densities, a proxy of functional neurotransmitter
   receptor abundance, did not show differences in the DG of Negr1-KO mice
   but altered ligand binding densities to NMDA receptor and muscarinic
   acetylcholine receptors M1 and M2 were found in CA1 and CA3. Activity
   behavior, anxiety-like behavior and sensorimotor gating were not
   different between genotypes. However, Negr1-KO mice exhibited impaired
   social behavior compared to WT littermates. Moreover, Negr1-KO mice
   showed reversal learning deficits in the Morris water maze and increased
   susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures. Thus, our
   results from neuronal growth assays, neuroanatomical analyses and
   behavioral assessments provide first evidence that deficiency of the
   psychiatric disease-associated Negr1 gene may affect neuronal growth and
   behavior. These findings might be relevant to further evaluate the role
   of NEGR1 in cognitive and psychiatric disorders.},

Title = {The Neurocognitive Correlates of Human Reasoning: A Meta-analysis of

Abstract = {Inferring knowledge is a core aspect of human cognition. We can form
   complex sentences connecting different pieces of information, such as in
   conditional statements like ``if someone drinks alcohol, then they must
   be older than 18.{''} These are relevant for causal reasoning about our
   environment and allow us to think about hypothetical scenarios. Another
   central aspect to forming complex statements is to quantify about sets,
   such as in ``some apples are green.{''} Reasoning in terms of the
   ability to form these statements is not yet fully understood, despite
   being an active field of interdisciplinary research. On a theoretical
   level, several conceptual frameworks have been proposed, predicting
   diverging brain activation patterns during the reasoning process. We
   present a meta-analysis comprising the results of 32 neuroimaging
   experiments about reasoning, which we subdivided by their structure,
   content, and requirement for world knowledge. In conditional tasks, we
   identified activation in the left middle and rostrolateral pFC and
   parietal regions, whereas syllogistic tasks elicit activation in Broca's
   complex, including the BG. Concerning the content differentiation,
   abstract tasks exhibit activation in the left inferior and rostrolateral
   pFC and inferior parietal regions, whereas content tasks are in the left
   superior pFC and parieto-occipital regions. The findings clarify the
   neurocognitive mechanisms of reasoning and exhibit clear distinctions
   between the task's type and content. Overall, we found that the
   activation differences clarify inconsistent results from accumulated
   data and serve as useful scaffolding differentiations for theory-driven
   interpretations of the neuroscientific correlates of human reasoning.},

Abstract = {Recording neural signals from delicate autonomic nerves is a challenging
   task that requires the development of a lowinvasive neural interface
   with highly selective, micrometer-sized electrodes. This paper reports
   on the development of a three-dimensional (3D) protruding thin-film
   microelectrode array (MEA), which is intended to be used for recording
   low-amplitude neural signals from pelvic nervous structures by
   penetrating the nerves transversely to reduce the distance to the axons.
   Cylindrical gold pillars (empty set 20 or 50 mu m, similar to 60 mu m
   height) were fabricated on a micromachined polyimide substrate in an
   electroplating process. Their sidewalls were insulated with parylene C,
   and their tips were optionally modified by wet etching and/or the
   application of a titanium nitride (TiN) coating. The microelectrodes
   modified by these combined techniques exhibited low impedances (similar
   to 7 k Omega at 1 kHz for empty set 50 mu m microelectrode with the
   exposed surface area of similar to 5000 mu m(2)) and low intrinsic noise
   levels. Their functionalities were evaluated in an ex vivo pilot study
   with mouse retinae, in which spontaneous neuronal spikes were recorded
   with amplitudes of up to 66 mu V. This novel process strategy for
   fabricating flexible, 3D neural interfaces with low-impedance
   microelectrodes has the potential to selectively record neural signals
   from not only delicate structures such as retinal cells but also
   autonomic nerves with improved signal quality to study neural circuits
   and develop stimulation strategies in bioelectronic medicine, e.g., for
   the control of vital digestive functions.},

Abstract = {Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) alleviates
   motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) but also affects the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC), potentially leading to cognitive side effects.
   The present study tested alterations within the rostro-caudal hierarchy
   of neural processing in the PFC induced by STN-DBS in PD.
   Granger-causality analyses of fast functional near-infrared spectroscopy
   (fNIRS) measurements were used to infer directed functional connectivity
   from intrinsic PFC activity in 24 PD patients treated with STN-DBS.
   Functional connectivity was assessed ON stimulation, in steady-state OFF
   stimulation and immediately after the stimulator was switched ON again.
   Results revealed that STN-DBS significantly enhanced the rostro-caudal
   hierarchical organization of the PFC in patients who had undergone
   implantation early in the course of the disease, whereas it attenuated
   the rostro-caudal hierarchy in late-implanted patients. Most crucially,
   this systematic network effect of STN-DBS was reproducible in the second
   ON stimulation measurement. Supplemental analyses demonstrated the
   significance of prefrontal networks for cognitive functions in patients
   and matched healthy controls. These findings show that the modulation of
   prefrontal functional networks by STN-DBS is dependent on the disease
   duration before DBS implantation and suggest a neurophysiological
   mechanism underlying the side effects on prefrontally-guided cognitive
   functions observed under STN-DBS.},

Abstract = {It is a core cognitive ability of humans to represent and reason about
   relational information, such as the train station is north of the hotel
   or Charles is richer than Jim. However, the neural processes underlying
   the ability to draw conclusions about relations are still not
   sufficiently understood. Central open questions are as follows: (1) What
   are the neural correlates of relational reasoning? (2) Where can
   deductive and inductive reasoning be localized? (3) What is the impact
   of different informational types on cerebral activity? For that, we
   conducted a meta-analysis of 47 neuroimaging studies. We found
   activation of the frontoparietal network during both deductive and
   inductive reasoning, with additional activation in an extended network
   during inductive reasoning in the basal ganglia and the inferior
   parietal cortex. Analyses revealed a double dissociation concerning the
   lateral and medial Brodmann's area 6 during deductive and inductive
   reasoning, indicating differences in terms of processing verbal
   information in deductive and spatial information in inductive tasks.
   During semantic and symbolic tasks, the frontoparietal network was found
   active, whereas geometric tasks only elicited prefrontal activation,
   which can be explained by the reduced demand for the construction of a
   mental representation in geometric tasks. Our study provides new
   insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying relational reasoning
   and clarifies previous controversies concerning involved brain areas.},

Title = {Hemodynamics of Cerebral Veins Analyzed by 2D and 4D Flow MRI and

Abstract = {Background: Hemodynamic alterations of extracranial veins are considered
   an etiologic factor in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, ultrasound and
   MRI studies could not confirm a pathophysiological link. Because of
   technical challenges using standard diagnostics, information about the
   involvement of superficial intracranial veins in proximity to the
   affected brain in MS is scarce.
   Purpose: To comprehensively investigate the hemodynamics of intracranial
   veins and of the venous outflow tract in MS patients and controls.
   Study Type: Prospective.
   Population: Twenty-eight patients with relapsing-remitting MS (EDSS1.9
   +/- 1.1; range 0-3) and 41 healthy controls.
   Field Strength/Sequence: 3T/2D phase-contrast and time-resolved 4D flow
   MRI, extra- and transcranial sonography.
   Assessment: Hemodynamics within the superficial and deep intracranial
   venous system and outflow tract including the internal, basal, and great
   cerebral vein, straight, superior sagittal, and transverse sinuses,
   internal jugular and vertebral veins. Sonography adhered to the chronic
   cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) criteria.
   Statistical Tests: Multivariate repeated measure analysis of variance,
   Student's two-sample t-test, chi-square, Fisher's exact test; separate
   analysis of the entire cohort and 32 age- and sex-matched participants.
   Results: Multi- and univariate main effects of the factor group (MS
   patient vs. control) and its interactions with the factor vessel
   position (lower flow within dorsal superior sagittal sinus in MS, 3 +/-
   1 ml/s vs. 3.8 +/- 1 ml/s; P < 0.05) in the uncontrolled cohort were
   attributable to age-related differences. Age- and sex-matched pairs
   showed a different velocity gradient in a single segment within the deep
   cerebral veins (great cerebral vein, vena cerebri magna {[}VCM] 7.6 +/-
   1.7 cm/s; straight sinus {[}StS] 10.5 +/- 2.2 cm/s vs. volunteers: VCM
   9.2 +/- 2.3 cm/s; StS 10.2 +/- 2.3 cm/s; P = 0.01), reaching comparable
   velocities instantaneously downstream. Sonography was not statistically
   different between groups.
   Data Conclusion: Consistent with previous studies focusing on
   extracranial hemodynamics, our comprehensive analysis of intracerebral
   venous blood flow did not reveal relevant differences between MS
   patients and controls.},

Title = {Neural system prediction and identification challenge},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Can we infer the function of a biological neural network (BNN) if we
   know the connectivity and activity of all its constituent neurons? This
   question is at the core of neuroscience and, accordingly, various
   methods have been developed to record the activity and connectivity of
   as many neurons as possible. Surprisingly, there is no theoretical or
   computational demonstration that neuronal activity and connectivity are
   indeed sufficient to infer the function of a BNN. Therefore, we pose the
   Neural Systems Identification and Prediction Challenge (nuSPIC). We
   provide the connectivity and activity of all neurons and invite
   participants (1) to infer the functions implemented (hard-wired) in
   spiking neural networks (SNNs) by stimulating and recording the activity
   of neurons and, (2) to implement predefined mathematical/biological
   functions using SNNs. The nuSPICs can be accessed via a web-interface to
   the NEST simulator and the user is not required to know any specific
   programming language. Furthermore, the nuSPICs can be used as a teaching
   tool. Finally, nuSPICs use the crowd-sourcing model to address
   scientific issues. With this computational approach we aim to identify
   which functions can be inferred by systematic recordings of neuronal
   activity and connectivity. In addition, nuSPICs will help the design and
   application of new experimental paradigms based on the structure of the
   SNN and the presumed function which is to be discovered.},

Abstract = {We study synthesis problems with constraints in partially observable
   Markov decision processes (POMDPs), where the objective is to compute a
   strategy for an agent that is guaranteed to satisfy certain safety and
   performance specifications. Verification and strategy synthesis for
   POMDPs are, however, computationally intractable in general. We
   alleviate this difficulty by focusing on planning applications and
   exploiting typical structural properties of such scenarios; for
   instance, we assume that the agent has the ability to observe its own
   position inside an environment. We propose an abstraction refinement
   framework, which turns such a POMDP model into a (fully observable)
   probabilistic two-player game (PG). For the obtained PGs, efficient
   verification and synthesis tools allow to determine strategies with
   optimal safety and performance measures, which approximate optimal
   schedulers on the POMDP. If the approximation is too coarse to satisfy
   the given specifications, a refinement scheme improves the computed
   strategies. As a running example, we use planning problems where an
   agent moves inside an environment with randomly moving obstacles and
   restricted observability. We demonstrate that the proposed method
   advances the state of the art by solving problems several orders of
   magnitude larger than those that can be handled by existing POMDP
   solvers. Furthermore, this method gives guarantees on safety
   constraints, which is not supported by the majority of the existing
   solvers.},

Abstract = {Objective This review article gives an account of the development of the
   MR-encephalography (MREG) method, which started as a mere
   `Gedankenexperiment' in 2005 and gradually developed into a method for
   ultrafast measurement of physiological activities in the brain. After
   going through different approaches covering k-space with radial,
   rosette, and concentric shell trajectories we have settled on a
   stack-of-spiral trajectory, which allows full brain coverage with
   (nominal) 3 mm isotropic resolution in 100 ms. The very high
   acceleration factor is facilitated by the near-isotropic k-space
   coverage, which allows high acceleration in all three spatial
   dimensions. Methods The methodological section covers the basic sequence
   design as well as recent advances in image reconstruction including the
   targeted reconstruction, which allows real-time feedback applications,
   and-most recently-the time-domain principal component reconstruction
   (tPCR), which applies a principal component analysis of the acquired
   time domain data as a sparsifying transformation to improve
   reconstruction speed as well as quality. Applications Although the
   BOLD-response is rather slow, the high speed acquisition of MREG allows
   separation of BOLD-effects from cardiac and breathing related
   pulsatility. The increased sensitivity enables direct detection of the
   dynamic variability of resting state networks as well as localization of
   single interictal events in epilepsy patients. A separate and highly
   intriguing application is aimed at the investigation of the glymphatic
   system by assessment of the spatiotemporal patterns of cardiac and
   breathing related pulsatility. Discussion MREG has been developed to
   push the speed limits of fMRI. Compared to multiband-EPI this allows
   considerably faster acquisition at the cost of reduced image quality and
   spatial resolution.},

Title = {Sparse Estimation of Resting-State Effective Connectivity From fMRI
   Cross-Spectra},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional connectivity
   is conventionally characterized by correlations between fMRI time
   series, which are intrinsically undirected measures of connectivity.
   Yet, some information about the directionality of network connections
   can nevertheless be extracted from the matrix of pairwise temporal
   correlations between all considered time series, when expressed in the
   frequency-domain as a cross-spectral density matrix. Using a sparsity
   prior, it then becomes possible to determine a unique directed network
   topology that best explains the observed undirected correlations,
   without having to rely on temporal precedence relationships that may not
   be valid in fMRI. Applying this method on simulated data with 100 nodes
   yielded excellent retrieval of the underlying directed networks under a
   wide variety of conditions. Importantly, the method did not depend on
   temporal precedence to establish directionality, thus reducing
   susceptibility to hemodynamic variability. The computational efficiency
   of the algorithm was sufficient to enable whole-brain estimations, thus
   circumventing the problem of missing nodes that otherwise occurs in
   partial-brain analyses. Applying the method to real resting-state fMRI
   data acquired with a high temporal resolution, the inferred networks
   showed good consistency with structural connectivity obtained from
   diffusion tractography in the same subjects. Interestingly, this
   agreement could also be seen when considering high-frequency rather than
   low-frequency connectivity (average correlation: r = 0.26 for f < 0.3
   Hz, r = 0.43 for 0.3 < f < 5 Hz). Moreover, this concordance was
   significantly better (p < 0.05) than for networks obtained with
   conventional functional connectivity based on correlations (average
   correlation r = 0.18). The presented methodology thus appears to be
   well-suited for fMRI, particularly given its lack of explicit dependence
   on temporal lag structure, and is readily applicable to whole-brain
   effective connectivity estimation.},

Title = {Persistent Discharges in Dentate Gyrus Perisoma-Inhibiting Interneurons
   Require Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channel

Abstract = {Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing perisoma-inhibiting interneurons (PIIs) of
   the dentate gyrus integrate rapidly correlated synaptic inputs and
   generate short-duration action potentials that propagate along the axon
   to their output synapses, supporting fast inhibitory signaling onto
   their target cells. Here we show that PV-PIIs in rat and mouse dentate
   gyrus (DG) integrate their intrinsic activity over time and can turn
   into a persistent firing mode characterized by the ability to generate
   long-lasting trains of action potentials at similar to 50 Hz in the
   absence of additional inputs. Persistent firing emerges in the axons
   remote from the axon initial segment and markedly depends on
   hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCNC)
   activation. Persistent firing properties are modulated by intracellular
   Ca2+ levels and somatic membrane potential. Detailed computational
   single-cell PIIs models reveal that HCNC-mediated conductances can
   contribute to persistent firing during conditions of a shift in their
   voltage activation curve to more depolarized potentials. Paired
   recordings from PIIs and their target granule cells show that persistent
   firing supports strong inhibitory output signaling. Thus, persistent
   firing may emerge during conditions of intense activation of the
   network, thereby providing silencing to the circuitry and the
   maintenance of sparse activity in the dentate gyrus.},

Abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to gain in vivo insight into
   load-induced displacements of inner plant tissues making a non-invasive
   and non-destructive stress and strain analysis possible. The central aim
   of this study was the identification of a possible load-adapted
   orientation of the vascular bundles and their fibre caps as the
   mechanically relevant tissue in branch-stem-attachments of Dracaena
   marginata. The complex three-dimensional deformations that occur during
   mechanical loading can be analysed on the basis of
   quasi-three-dimensional data representations of the outer surface, the
   inner tissue arrangement (meristem and vascular system), and the course
   of single vascular bundles within the branch-stem-attachment region. In
   addition, deformations of vascular bundles could be quantified manually
   and by using digital image correlation software. This combination of
   qualitative and quantitative stress and strain analysis leads to an
   improved understanding of the functional morphology and biomechanics of
   D. marginata, a plant that is used as a model organism for optimizing
   branched technical fibre-reinforced lightweight trusses in order to

Title = {A Robust Screen-Free Brain-Computer Interface for Robotic Object
   Selection},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Brain signals represent a communication modality that can allow users of
   assistive robots to specify high-level goals, such as the object to
   fetch and deliver. In this paper, we consider a screen-free
   Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), where the robot highlights candidate
   objects in the environment using a laser pointer, and the user goal is
   decoded from the evoked responses in the electroencephalogram (EEG).
   Having the robot present stimuli in the environment allows for more
   direct commands than traditional BCIs that require the use of graphical
   user interfaces. Yet bypassing a screen entails less control over
   stimulus appearances. In realistic environments, this leads to
   heterogeneous brain responses for dissimilar objects-posing a challenge
   for reliable EEG classification. We model object instances as subclasses
   to train specialized classifiers in the Riemannian tangent space, each
   of which is regularized by incorporating data from other objects. In
   multiple experiments with a total of 19 healthy participants, we show
   that our approach not only increases classification performance but is
   also robust to both heterogeneous and homogeneous objects. While
   especially useful in the case of a screen-free BCI, our approach can
   naturally be applied to other experimental paradigms with potential
   subclass structure.},

Title = {Towards User-Friendly Spelling with an Auditory Brain-Computer
   Interface: The CharStreamer Paradigm},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Realizing the decoding of brain signals into control commands,
   brain-computer interfaces (BCI) aim to establish an alternative
   communication pathway for locked-in patients. In contrast to most visual
   BCI approaches which use event-related potentials (ERP) of the
   electroencephalogram, auditory BCI systems are challenged with ERP
   responses, which are less class-discriminant between attended and
   unattended stimuli. Furthermore, these auditory approaches have more
   complex interfaces which imposes a substantial workload on their users.
   Aiming for a maximally user-friendly spelling interface, this study
   introduces a novel auditory paradigm: ``CharStreamer{''}. The speller
   can be used with an instruction as simple as ``please attend to what you
   want to spell{''}. The stimuli of CharStreamer comprise 30 spoken sounds
   of letters and actions. As each of them is represented by the sound of
   itself and not by an artificial substitute, it can be selected in a
   one-step procedure. The mental mapping effort (sound stimuli to actions)
   is thus minimized. Usability is further accounted for by an alphabetical
   stimulus presentation: contrary to random presentation orders, the user
   can foresee the presentation time of the target letter sound. Healthy,
   normal hearing users (n = 10) of the CharStreamer paradigm displayed ERP
   responses that systematically differed between target and non-target
   sounds. Class-discriminant features, however, varied individually from
   the typical N1-P2 complex and P3 ERP components found in control
   conditions with random sequences. To fully exploit the sequential
   presentation structure of CharStreamer, novel data analysis approaches
   and classification methods were introduced. The results of online
   spelling tests showed that a competitive spelling speed can be achieved
   with CharStreamer. With respect to user rating, it clearly outperforms a
   control setup with random presentation sequences.},

Title = {Existence and Control of Go/No-Go Decision Transition Threshold in the
   Striatum},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A typical Go/No-Go decision is suggested to be implemented in the brain
   via the activation of the direct or indirect pathway in the basal
   ganglia. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, receiving input
   from cortex and projecting to the direct and indirect pathways express
   D1 and D2 type dopamine receptors, respectively. Recently, it has become
   clear that the two types of MSNs markedly differ in their mutual and
   recurrent connectivities as well as feedforward inhibition from FSIs.
   Therefore, to understand striatal function in action selection, it is of
   key importance to identify the role of the distinct connectivities
   within and between the two types of MSNs on the balance of their
   activity. Here, we used both a reduced firing rate model and numerical
   simulations of a spiking network model of the striatum to analyze the
   dynamic balance of spiking activities in D1 and D2 MSNs. We show that
   the asymmetric connectivity of the two types of MSNs renders the
   striatum into a threshold device, indicating the state of cortical input
   rates and correlations by the relative activity rates of D1 and D2 MSNs.
   Next, we describe how this striatal threshold can be effectively
   modulated by the activity of fast spiking interneurons, by the dopamine
   level, and by the activity of the GPe via pallidostriatal
   backprojections. We show that multiple mechanisms exist in the basal
   ganglia for biasing striatal output in favour of either the `Go' or the
   `No-Go' pathway. This new understanding of striatal network dynamics
   provides novel insights into the putative role of the striatum in

Title = {Gradient-Induced Mechanical Vibration of Neural Interfaces During MRI},

Abstract = {Objective: Resonant vibrations of implanted structures during a magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) procedure pose a risk to the patient in the form
   of soft tissue irritation and degradation of the implant. In this paper,
   the mechanical behavior of implant structures in air, water, and
   viscoelastic materials was explored. Methods: The static and dynamic
   transfer functions of various test samples in air and immersed in both
   water and hydrogels were analyzed. The laser-based acquisition method
   allowed for high-angular-resolution (10 \$ \textbackslash{}mu\$Deg) and
   high-dynamic-range (0-6 kHz) measurements. Additional MRI experiments
   were conducted to investigate the dependence of vibration strength on
   magnetic resonance (MR) sequence parameters in combination with the
   obtained transfer functions. Results: The largest forces were found to
   be in the micronewton to millinewton range, which is comparable to
   forces applied during implantation. Of additional concern was the
   damping introduced by viscoelastic tissue, which was less than expected,
   leading to an underdamped system. In contrast to current wisdom, the
   imaging experiments demonstrated drastically different vibration
   amplitudes for identical gradient slew rates, but different timing
   parameters TR, mainly due to resonant amplification. Conclusion: The
   results showed that a safe force-free MR procedure depends not only on
   the gradient slew rate, but also and more drastically on the choice of
   secure timing parameters. Significance: These findings delineate design
   improvements to achieve longevity of implants and will lead to increased
   patient safety during MRI. A prudent choice of mechanical
   characteristics of implanted structures is sufficient to avoid resonant
   excitation due to mismatched MR sequence parameters.},

Abstract = {Simultaneous recordings and manipulations of neural circuits that
   control the behavior of animals is one of the key techniques in modern
   neuroscience. Rapid advances in optogenetics have led to a variety of
   probes combining multichannel readout and optogenetic write in. Given
   the complexity of the brain, it comes as no surprise that the choice of
   the device is constrained by several factors such as the animal model,
   the structure and location of the brain area of interest, as well as the
   behavioral read out. Here we provide an overview of available devices
   for chronic simultaneous neural recordings and optogenetic manipulation
   in awake behaving rats. We focus on two fixed arrays and two moveable
   drives. For both options, we present data from one custom made (in
   house) and one commercially available device. Here we provide evidence
   that simultaneous neural recordings and optogenetic manipulations are
   feasible with all four tested devices. Further we give detailed
   information about the recording quality, and also contrast the different
   features of the probes. As we provide detailed information about
   equipment and building procedures for combined chronic multichannel
   readout and optogenetic control with maximum performance at minimized
   costs, this overview might help especially researchers who want to enter
   the field of in vivo optophysiology.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {When hearing fails, electrical cochlear implants (eCIs) provide the
   brain with auditory information. One important bottleneck of CIs is the
   poor spectral selectivity that results from the wide current spread from
   each of the electrode contacts. Optical CIs (oCIs) promise to make
   better use of the tonotopic order of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs)
   inside the cochlea by spatially confined stimulation. Here, we
   established multichannel oCIs based on light-emitting diode (LED) arrays
   and used them for optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin
   (ChR)-expressing SGNs in rodents. Power-efficient blue LED chips were
   integrated onto microfabricated 15-mu m-thin polyimide-based carriers
   comprising interconnecting lines to address individual LEDs by a
   stationary or mobile driver circuitry. We extensively characterized the
   optoelectronic, thermal, and mechanical properties of the oCIs and
   demonstrated stability over weeks in vitro. We then implanted the oCIs
   into ChR-expressing rats and gerbils, and characterized multichannel
   optogenetic SGN stimulation by electrophysiological and behavioral
   experiments. Improved spectral selectivity was directly demonstrated by
   recordings from the auditory midbrain. Long-term experiments in deafened
   ChR-expressing rats and in nontreated control animals demonstrated
   specificity of optogenetic stimulation. Behavioral studies on animals
   carrying a wireless oCI sound processor revealed auditory percepts. This
   study demonstrates hearing restoration with improved spectral
   selectivity by an LED-based multichannel oCI system.},

Abstract = {The hippocampus is reciprocally connectedwith the entorhinal cortex.
   Although several studies emphasized a role for the entorhinal cortex in
   mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), it remains uncertain whether its
   synaptic connections with the hippocampus are altered. To address this
   question, we traced hippocampo-entorhinal and entorhino-hippocampal
   projections, assessed their connectivity with the respective target
   cells and examined functional alterations in a mouse model for MTLE. We
   show that hippocampal afferents to the dorsal entorhinal cortex are lost
   in the epileptic hippocampus. Conversely, entorhino-dentate projections
   via the medial perforant path (MPP) are preserved, but appear
   substantially altered on the synaptic level. Confocal imaging and
   3D-reconstruction revealed that new putative contacts are established
   between MPP fibers and dentate granule cells (DGCs). Immunohistochemical
   identification of pre-and postsynaptic elements indicated that these
   contacts are functionally mature synapses. On the ultrastructural level,
   pre-and postsynaptic compartments of MPP synapses were strongly
   enlarged. The length and complexity of postsynaptic densities were also
   increased pointing to long-termpotentiation-relatedmorphogenesis.
   Finally, wholecell recordings of DGCs revealed an enhancement of evoked
   excitatory postsynaptic currents. In conclusion, the synaptic
   rearrangement of excitatory inputs to DGCs from th emedial entorhinal
   cortex may contribute to the epileptogenic circuitry in MTLE.},

Abstract = {The recent introduction of glassy carbon (GC) microstructures supported
   on flexible polymeric substrates has motivated the adoption of GC in a
   variety of implantable and wearable devices. Neural probes such as
   electrocorticography and penetrating shanks with GC microelectrode
   arrays used for neural signal recording and electrical stimulation are
   among the first beneficiaries of this technology. With the expected
   proliferation of these neural probes and potential clinical adoption,
   the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility of GC microstructures
   needs to be established to help validate this potential in clinical
   settings. Here, we present GC microelectrodes and
   microstructures-fabricated through the carbon micro-electro-mechanical
   systems process and supported on flexible polymeric substrates-and carry
   out experimental measurements of induced vibrations, eddy currents, and
   artifacts. Through induced vibration, induced voltage, and MRI
   experiments and finite element modeling, we compared the performances of
   these GC microelectrodes against those of conventional thin-film
   platinum (Pt) microelectrodes and established that GC microelectrodes
   demonstrate superior magnetic resonance compatibility over standard
   metal thin-film microelectrodes. Specifically, we demonstrated that GC
   microelectrodes experienced no considerable vibration deflection
   amplitudes and minimal induced currents, while Pt microelectrodes had
   significantly larger currents. We also showed that because of their low
   magnetic susceptibility and lower conductivity, the GC microelectrodes
   caused almost no susceptibility shift artifacts and no
   eddy-current-induced artifacts compared to Pt microelectrodes. Taken
   together, the experimental, theoretical, and finite element modeling
   establish that GC microelectrodes exhibit significant MRI compatibility,
   hence demonstrating clear clinical advantages over current conventional
   thin-film materials, further opening avenues for wider adoption of GC
   microelectrodes in chronic clinical applications.},

   Fiber Mats},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Polymer-derived carbon can serve as an electrode material in multimodal
   neural stimulation, recording, and neurotransmitter sensing platforms.
   The primary challenge in its applicability in implantable, flexible
   neural devices is its characteristic mechanical hardness that renders it
   difficult to fabricate the entire device using only carbon. A
   microfabrication technique is introduced for patterning flexible,
   cloth-like, polymer-derived carbon fiber (CF) mats embedded in polyimide
   (PI), via selective reactive ion etching. This scalable, monolithic
   manufacturing method eliminates any joints or metal interconnects and
   creates electrocorticography electrode arrays based on a single CF mat.
   The batch-fabricated CF/PI composite structures, with critical dimension
   of 12.5 mu m, are tested for their mechanical, electrical, and
   electrochemical stability, as well as to chemicals that mimic acute
   postsurgery inflammatory reactions. Their recording performance is
   validated in rat models. Reported CF patterning process can benefit
   various carbon microdevices that are expected to feature flexibility,
   material stability, and biocompatibility.},

Abstract = {The metabolism of an organism is regulated at the cellular level, yet is
   strongly influenced by its environment. The precise metabolomic study of
   living organisms is currently hampered by measurement sensitivity; most
   metabolomic measurement techniques involve some compromise, whereby
   averaging is performed over a volume significantly larger than a single
   cell, or require the invasion of the organism, or an arrested state of
   the organism. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an inherently
   noninvasive chemometric and imaging method, and hence, in principle,
   suitable for metabolomic measurements. The digital twin of metabolomics
   is computational systems biology, such that NMR microscopy is
   potentially a viable approach to joining the theoretical and
   experimental explorations of the metabolomic and behavioural responses
   of organisms. In this study, we consider the challenge of performing in
   vivo NMR-based metabolomics on the small organism Caenorhabditis
   elegans, point the way towards possible solutions created using
   techniques specific to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)
   fabrication, and highlight currently insurmountable challenges.},

Title = {Effects of Optogenetic Stimulation of Primary Somatosensory Cortex and
   Its Projections to Striatum on Vibrotactile Perception in Freely Moving
   Rats},
Journal = {ENEURO},

Abstract = {Tactile sensation is one of our primary means to collect information
   about the nearby environment and thus crucial for daily activities and
   survival. Therefore, it is of high importance to restore sensory
   feedback after sensory loss. Optogenetic manipulation allows local or
   pathway-specific write-in of information. However, it remains elusive
   whether optogenetic stimulation can be interpreted as tactile sensation
   to guide operant behavior and how it is integrated with tactile stimuli.
   To address these questions, we employed a vibrotactile detection task
   combined with optogenetic neuromodulation in freely moving rats. By
   bidirectionally manipulating the activity of neurons in primary
   somatosensory cortex (S1), we demonstrated that optical activation as
   well as inhibition of S1 reduced the detection rate for vibrotactile
   stimuli. Interestingly, activation of corticostriatal terminals improved
   the detection of tactile stimuli, while inhibition of corticostriatal
   terminals did not affect the performance. To manipulate the
   corticostriatal pathway more specifically, we employed a dual viral
   system. Activation of corticostriatal cell bodies disturbed the tactile
   perception while activation of corticostriatal terminals slightly
   facilitated the detection of vibrotactile stimuli. In the absence of
   tactile stimuli, both corticostriatal cell bodies as well as terminals
   caused a reaction. Taken together, our data confirmed the possibility to
   restore sensation using optogenetics and demonstrated that S1 and its
   descending projections to striatum play differential roles in the neural
   processing underlying vibrotactile detection.},

Title = {Associative properties of structural plasticity based on firing rate
   homeostasis in recurrent neuronal networks},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Correlation-based Hebbian plasticity is thought to shape neuronal
   connectivity during development and learning, whereas homeostatic
   plasticity would stabilize network activity. Here we investigate
   another, new aspect of this dichotomy: Can Hebbian associative
   properties also emerge as a network effect from a plasticity rule based
   on homeostatic principles on the neuronal level? To address this
   question, we simulated a recurrent network of leaky integrate-and-fire
   neurons, in which excitatory connections are subject to a structural
   plasticity rule based on firing rate homeostasis. We show that a
   subgroup of neurons develop stronger within-group connectivity as a
   consequence of receiving stronger external stimulation. In an
   experimentally well-documented scenario we show that feature specific
   connectivity, similar to what has been observed in rodent visual cortex,
   can emerge from such a plasticity rule. The experience-dependent
   structural changes triggered by stimulation are long-lasting and decay
   only slowly when the neurons are exposed again to unspecific external
   inputs.},

   hyperparameters or many function evaluations. Attacking this lack of
   scalability and flexibility is thus one of the key challenges of the
   field. We present a general approach for using flexible parametric
   models (neural networks) for Bayesian optimization, staying as close to
   a truly Bayesian treatment as possible. We obtain scalability through
   stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, whose robustness we improve
   via a scale adaptation. Experiments including multi-task Bayesian
   optimization with 21 tasks, parallel optimization of deep neural
   networks and deep reinforcement learning show the power and flexibility
   of this approach.},

Abstract = {Objective: Electric fields (EF) of approx. 0.2 V/m have been shown to be
   sufficiently strong to both modulate neuronal activity in the cerebral
   cortex and have measurable effects on cognitive performance. We
   hypothesized that the EF caused by the electrical activity of
   extracranial muscles during natural chewing may reach similar strength
   in the cerebral cortex and hence might act as an endogenous modality of
   brain stimulation. Here, we present first steps toward validating this
   hypothesis. Methods: Using a realistic volume conductor head model of an
   epilepsy patient having undergone intracranial electrode placement and
   utilizing simultaneous intracranial and extracranial electrical
   recordings during chewing, we derive predictions about the
   chewing-related cortical EF strength to be expected in healthy
   individuals. Results: We find that in the region of the temporal poles,
   the expected EF strength may reach amplitudes in the order of 0.1-1 V/m.
   Conclusion: The cortical EF caused by natural chewing could be large
   enough to modulate ongoing neural activity in the cerebral cortex and
   influence cognitive performance. Significance: The present study lends
   first support for the assumption that extracranial muscle activity might
   represent an endogenous source of electrical brain stimulation. This
   offers a new potential explanation for the puzzling effects of gum
   chewing on cognition, which have been repeatedly reported in the
   literature.},

Title = {Advanced Cardiac Rhythm Management by Applying Optogenetic Multi-Site
   Photostimulation in Murine Hearts},
Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},

Abstract = {Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are a major cause of mortality and
   morbidity worldwide. Electrical defibrillation using high-energy
   electric shocks is currently the only treatment for life-threatening
   ventricular fibrillation. However, defibrillation may have side-effects,
   including intolerable pain, tissue damage, and worsening of prognosis,
   indicating a significant medical need for the development of more gentle
   cardiac rhythm management strategies. Besides energy-reducing electrical
   approaches, cardiac optogenetics was introduced as a powerful tool to
   influence cardiac activity using lightsensitive membrane ion channels
   and light pulses. In the present study, a robust and valid method for
   successful photostimulation of Langendorff perfused intact murine hearts
   will be described based on multi-site pacing applying a 3 x 3 array of
   micro light emitting diodes (micro-LED). Simultaneous optical mapping of
   epicardial membrane voltage waves allows the investigation of the
   effects of region-specific stimulation and evaluates the newly induced
   cardiac activity directly on-site. The obtained results show that the
   efficacy of defibrillation is strongly dependent on the parameters
   chosen for photostimulation during a cardiac arrhythmia. It will be
   demonstrated that the illuminated area of the heart plays a crucial role
   for termination success as well as how the targeted control of cardiac
   activity during illumination for modifying arrhythmia patterns can be
   achieved. In summary, this technique provides a possibility to optimize
   the on-site mechanism manipulation on the way to real-time feedback
   control of cardiac rhythm and, regarding the region specificity, new
   approaches in reducing the potential harm to the cardiac system compared
   to the usage of non-specific electrical shock applications.},

Title = {Carbon-based neural electrodes: promises and challenges},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Neural electrodes are primary functional elements of neuroelectronic
   devices designed to record neural activity based on electrochemical
   signals. These electrodes may also be utilized for electrically
   stimulating the neural cells, such that their response can be
   simultaneously recorded. In addition to being medically safe, the
   electrode material should be electrically conductive and
   electrochemically stable under harsh biological environments. Mechanical
   flexibility and conformability, resistance to crack formation and
   compatibility with common microfabrication techniques are equally
   desirable properties. Traditionally, (noble) metals have been the
   preferred for neural electrode applications due to their proven
   biosafety and a relatively high electrical conductivity. Carbon is a
   recent addition to this list, which is far superior in terms of its
   electrochemical stability and corrosion resistance. Carbon has also
   enabled 3D electrode fabrication as opposed to the thin-film based 2D
   structures. One of carbon's peculiar aspects is its availability in a
   wide range of allotropes with specialized properties that render it
   highly versatile. These variations, however, also make it difficult to
   understand carbon itself as a unique material, and thus, each allotrope
   is often regarded independently. Some carbon types have already shown
   promising results in bioelectronic medicine, while many others remain
   potential candidates. In this topical review, we first provide a broad
   overview of the neuroelectronic devices and the basic requirements of an
   electrode material. We subsequently discuss the carbon family of
   materials and their properties that are useful in neural applications.
   Examples of devices fabricated using bulk and nano carbon materials are
   reviewed and critically compared. We then summarize the challenges,
   future prospects and next-generation carbon technology that can be
   helpful in the field of neural sciences. The article aims at providing a
   common platform to neuroscientists, electrochemists, biologists,
   microsystems engineers and carbon scientists to enable active and
   comprehensive efforts directed towards carbon-based neuroelectronic
   device fabrication.},

Abstract = {The suppression of inappropriate actions is critical for flexible
   behavior. Cortical-basal ganglia networks provide key gating mechanisms
   for action suppression, yet the specific roles of neuronal
   subpopulations are poorly understood. Here, we examine Arkypallidal
   ({''}Arky'') and Prototypical ({''}Proto'') globus pallidus neurons
   during a Stop task, which requires abrupt cancellation of an imminent
   action. We first establish that Arky neurons can be identified by their
   firing properties across the natural sleep/wake cycle. We then show that
   Stop responses are earlier and stronger in the Arky compared to the
   Proto subpopulation. In contrast to other basal ganglia neurons,
   pallidal Stop responses are selective to Stop, rather than Go, cues.
   Furthermore, the timing of these Stop responses matches the suppression
   of developing striatal Go-related activity. Our results support a
   two-step model of action suppression: actions-inpreparation are first
   paused via a subthalamic-nigral pathway, then cancelled via Arky
   GABAergic projections to striatum.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the development, i.e., the design, fabrication,
   and validation of an implantable optical neural probes designed for in
   vivo experiments relying on optogenetics. The probes comprise an array
   of ten bare lightemitting diode (LED) chips emitting at a wavelength of
   460 nm and integrated along a flexible polyimide-based substrate
   stiffened using a micromachined ladder-like silicon structure. The
   resulting mechanical stiffness of the slender, 250-mu m-wide, 65-mu
   m-thick, and 5- and 8-mm-long probe shank facilitates its implantation
   into neural tissue. The LEDs are encapsulated by a fluropolymer coating
   protecting the implant against the physiological conditions in the
   brain. The electrical interface to the external control unit is provided
   by 10-mu m-thick, highly flexible polyimide cables making the probes
   suitable for both acute and chronic in vivo experiments. Optical and
   electrical properties of the probes are reported, as well as their in
   vivo validation in acute optogenetic studies in transgenic mice. The
   depth(dependent optical stimulation of both excitatory and inhibitory
   neurons is demonstrated by altering the brain activity in the cortex and
   the thalamus. Local network responses elicited by 20(ms(long light
   pulses of different optical power (20 mu Wand 1 mW), as well as local
   modulation of single unit neuronal activity to 1(s(long light pulses
   with low optical intensity (17 mu W) are presented. The ability to
   modulate neural activity makes these devices suitable for a broad
   variety of optogenetic experiments.},

Title = {Learning from label proportions in brain-computer interfaces: Online
   unsupervised learning with guarantees},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 13},
Abstract = {Objective Using traditional approaches, a brain-computer interface (BCI)
   requires the collection of calibration data for new subjects prior to
   online use. Calibration time can be reduced or eliminated e.g., by
   subject-to-subject transfer of a pre-trained classifier or unsupervised
   adaptive classification methods which learn from scratch and adapt over
   time. While such heuristics work well in practice, none of them can
   provide theoretical guarantees. Our objective is to modify an
   event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to work in unison with the
   machine learning decoder, and thus to achieve a reliable unsupervised
   calibrationless decoding with a guarantee to recover the true class
   means.
   Method We introduce learning from label proportions (LLP) to the BCI
   community as a new unsupervised, and easy-to-implement classification
   approach for ERP-based BCIs. The LLP estimates the mean target and
   non-target responses based on known proportions of these two classes in
   different groups of the data. We present a visual ERP speller to meet
   the requirements of LLP. For evaluation, we ran simulations on
   artificially created data sets and conducted an online BCI study with 13
   subjects performing a copy-spelling task.
   Results Theoretical considerations show that LLP is guaranteed to
   minimize the loss function similar to a corresponding supervised
   classifier. LLP performed well in simulations and in the online
   application, where 84.5\% of characters were spelled correctly on
   average without prior calibration.
   Significance The continuously adapting LLP classifier is the first
   unsupervised decoder for ERP BCIs guaranteed to find the optimal
   decoder. This makes it an ideal solution to avoid tedious calibration
   sessions. Additionally, LLP works on complementary principles compared
   to existing unsupervised methods, opening the door for their further
   enhancement when combined with LLP.},

Title = {Propagation of orientation selectivity in a spiking network model of
   layered primary visual cortex},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Neurons in different layers of sensory cortex generally have different
   functional properties. But what determines firing rates and tuning
   properties of neurons in different layers? Orientation selectivity in
   primary visual cortex (V1) is an interesting case to study these
   questions. Thalamic projections essentially determine the preferred
   orientation of neurons that receive direct input. But how is this tuning
   propagated though layers, and how can selective responses emerge in
   layers that do not have direct access to the thalamus? Here we combine
   numerical simulations with mathematical analyses to address this
   problem. We find that a large-scale network, which just accounts for
   experimentally measured layer and cell-type specific connection
   probabilities, yields firing rates and orientation selectivities
   matching electrophysiological recordings in rodent V1 surprisingly well.
   Further analysis, however, is complicated by the fact that neuronal
   responses emerge in a dynamic fashion and cannot be directly inferred
   from static neuroanatomy, as some connections tend to have unintuitive
   effects due to recurrent interactions and strong feedback loops. These
   emergent phenomena can be understood by linearizing and coarse-graining.
   In fact, we were able to derive a low-dimensional linear dynamical
   system effectively describing stimulus-driven activity layer by layer.
   This low-dimensional system explains layer-specific firing rates and
   orientation tuning by accounting for the different gain factors of the
   aggregate system. Our theory can also be used to design novel
   optogenetic stimulation experiments, thus facilitating further
   exploration of the interplay between connectivity and function.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on event-related
   potentials (ERP) incorporate a decoder to classify recorded brain
   signals and subsequently select a control signal that drives a computer
   application. Standard supervised BCI decoders require a tedious
   calibration procedure prior to every session. Several unsupervised
   classification methods have been proposed that tune the decoder during
   actual use and as such omit this calibration. Each of these methods has
   its own strengths and weaknesses. Our aim is to improve overall accuracy
   of ERP-based BCIs without calibration. Approach. We consider two
   approaches for unsupervised classification of ERP signals. Learning from
   label proportions (LLP) was recently shown to be guaranteed to converge
   to a supervised decoder when enough data is available. In contrast, the
   formerly proposed expectation maximization (EM) based decoding for
   ERP-BCI does not have this guarantee. However, while this decoder has
   high variance due to random initialization of its parameters, it obtains
   a higher accuracy faster than LLP when the initialization is good. We
   introduce a method to optimally combine these two unsupervised decoding
   methods, letting one method's strengths compensate for the weaknesses of
   the other and vice versa. The new method is compared to the
   aforementioned methods in a resimulation of an experiment with a visual
   speller. Main results. Analysis of the experimental results shows that
   the new method exceeds the performance of the previous unsupervised
   classification approaches in terms of ERP classification accuracy and
   symbol selection accuracy during the spelling experiment. Furthermore,
   the method shows less dependency on random initialization of model
   parameters and is consequently more reliable. Significance. Improving
   the accuracy and subsequent reliability of calibrationless BCIs makes
   these systems more appealing for frequent use.},

Abstract = {Simulation software for spiking neuronal network models matured in the
   past decades regarding performance and flexibility. But the entry
   barrier remains high for students and early career scientists in
   computational neuroscience since these simulators typically require
   programming skills and a complex installation. Here, we describe an
   installation-free Graphical User Interface (GUI) running in the web
   browser, which is distinct from the simulation engine running anywhere,
   on the student's laptop or on a supercomputer. This architecture
   provides robustness against technological changes in the software stack
   and simplifies deployment for self-education and for teachers. Our new
   open-source tool, NEST Desktop, comprises graphical elements for
   creating and configuring network models, running simulations, and
   visualizing and analyzing the results. NEST Desktop allows students to
   explore important concepts in computational neuroscience without the
   need to learn a simulator control language before. Our experiences so
   far highlight that NEST Desktop helps advancing both quality and
   intensity of teaching in computational neuroscience in regular
   university courses. We view the availability of the tool on public
   resources like the European ICT infrastructure for neuroscience EBRAINS
   as a contribution to equal opportunities.},

Abstract = {To autonomously carry out complex mobile manipulation tasks, a robot
   control system has to integrate several components for perception, world
   modeling, action planning and replanning, navigation, and manipulation.
   In this paper, we present a modular framework that is based on the
   Temporal Fast Downward Planner and supports external modules to control
   the robot. This allows to tightly integrate individual sub-systems with
   the high-level symbolic planner and enables a humanoid robot to solve
   challenging mobile manipulation tasks. In the work presented here, we
   address mobile manipulation with humanoids in cluttered environments,
   particularly the task of collecting objects and delivering them to
   designated places in a home-like environment while clearing obstacles
   out of the way. We implemented our system for a Nao humanoid tidying up
   a room, i.e., the robot has to collect items scattered on the floor,
   move obstacles out of its way, and deliver the objects to designated
   target locations. Despite the limited sensing and motion capabilities of
   the low-cost platform, the experiments show that our approach results in
   reliable task execution by applying monitoring actions to verify object
   and robot states.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a telemetric orthodontic bracket instrumented with a
   CMOS stress sensor chip which makes it possible to measure the 3D force
   and moment vectors acting on individual teeth. For the first time, this
   sensor system was equipped with the slot component of a standard ceramic
   bracket and was telemetrically read out over a distance sufficient to
   allow contactless operation in orthodontic applications. The maximum
   distance between the external reader coil and the microcoil within the
   bracket is 2.4 mm. The minimal transferred power to keep the system in
   operation is 17 mW. The 2x2.5-mm(2) -small Cu microcoil is embedded in
   SU-8, comprises 35 windings and is 22 pm in height. A reader unit which
   maximizes the transferable power while simplifying the electronic
   equipment was designed. The reader coil was tuned to resonance at 13.56
   MHz in agreement with the ISM band reserved for medical RFID systems.
   The telemetrically extracted sensor data are demodulated, digitized and
   decoded by the reader unit, which is connected to a graphical user
   interface. Force and moment values were successfully measured with
   resolutions better than 60 mN and 0.14 Nmm, respectively.},

Abstract = {Paralysis is a frequent phenomenon in many diseases, and to date, only
   functional electrical stimulation (FES) mediated via the innervating
   nerve can be employed to restore skeletal muscle function in patients.
   Despite recent progress, FES has several technical limitations and
   significant side effects. Optogenetic stimulation has been proposed as
   an alternative, as it may circumvent some of the disadvantages of FES
   enabling cell type-specific, spatially and temporally precise
   stimulation of cells expressing light-gated ion channels, commonly
   Channelrhodopsin2. Two distinct approaches for the restoration of
   skeletal muscle function with optogenetics have been demonstrated:
   indirect optogenetic stimulation through the innervating nerve similar
   to FES and direct optogenetic stimulation of the skeletal muscle.
   Although both approaches show great promise, both have their limitations
   and there are several general hurdles that need to be overcome for their
   translation into clinics. These include successful gene transfer,
   sustained optogenetic protein expression, and the creation of optically
   active implantable devices. Herein, a comprehensive summary of the
   underlying mechanisms of electrical and optogenetic approaches is
   provided. With this knowledge in mind, we substantiate a detailed
   discussion of the advantages and limitations of each method.
   Furthermore, the obstacles in the way of clinical translation of
   optogenetic stimulation are discussed, and suggestions on how they could
   be overcome are provided. Finally, four specific examples of pathologies
   demanding novel therapeutic measures are discussed with a focus on the
   likelihood of direct versus indirect optogenetic stimulation.},

Title = {Concurrent control of a brain-computer interface and natural overt

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective. A primary control signal in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
   have been cortical signals related to movement. However, in cases where
   natural motor function remains, BCI control signals may interfere with
   other possibly simultaneous activity for useful ongoing movement. We
   sought to determine if the brain could learn to control both a BCI and
   concurrent overt movement execution in such cases. Approach. We designed
   experiments where BCI and overt movements must be used concurrently and
   in coordination to achieve a 2D centre out control. Power in the 70-90
   Hz band of human electrocorticography (ECoG) signals, was used to
   generate BCI control commands for vertical movement of the cursor. These
   signals were deliberately recorded from the same human cortical site
   that produced the strongest movement related activity associated with
   the concurrent overt finger movements required for the horizontal
   movement of the cursor. Main results. We demonstrate that three subjects
   were able to perform the concurrent BCI task, controlling BCI and
   natural movements simultaneously and to a large extent independently. We
   conclude that the brain is capable of dissociating the original control
   signal dependency on movement, producing specific BCI control signals in
   the presence of motor related responses from the ongoing overt behaviour
   with which the BCI signal was initially correlated. Significance. We
   demonstrate a novel human brain-computer interface (BCI) which can be
   used to control movement concurrently and in coordination with movements
   of the natural limbs. This demonstrates the dissociation of cortical
   activity from the behaviour with which it was originally associated
   despite the ongoing behaviour and shows the feasibility of achieving
   simultaneous BCI control of devices with natural movements.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a novel telemetric smart bracket (TSB) for in vivo
   force/moment measurements during clinical orthodontic applications. The
   prototype implements a novel microcoil design resulting in a significant
   increase of the transmission distance compared to the previous
   state-of-the-art TSB. Using an automatic wirebonder, the microcoil is
   wound around an SU-8 post attached to the CMOS sensor wafer. For the
   first time, thus, 3D wirebonder-fabricated microcoils were integrated on
   a CMOS substrate, without compromising CMOS functionality. The augmented
   CMOS system serves here as a force/moment measurement device with
   six-degree-of-freedom (f(x), f(y), f(z),m(x),m(y), m(z)) functionality.
   The achieved transmission distance, i.e. coil-to-coil distance, was
   thereby increased by 80\% compared to the best previous design to 5 mm,
   without the need for the system to exceed the severe size constraints of
   2x2.8x1 mm(3) defined by the bracket dimensions. The increased
   transmission distance allows uncritical contactless system powering and
   readout.},

Abstract = {3D glassy carbon structures with percolated macropores are obtained by
   pyrolysis of chemically synthesized cryogels featuring tunable porosity.
   These batch-fabricated structures are used as scaffolds for culturing
   neural stem cells (NSCs) and are characterized by magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI). With the aid of MRI, the successful cultivation of NSCs
   on a glassy carbon surface and the precise 3D locations of these cell
   clusters within the opaque scaffold are demonstrated. MRI also yields
   pore morphology and porosity analyses, pre- and post-pyrolysis. This
   integrated approach yields a complete 3D dataset of the NSC network,
   which enables the visual inspection of the morphological details of
   individual cell clusters without disturbing them or destroying the
   scaffold. Reported experimental methodology is expected to have an
   impact on studies designed to understand the mechanism of
   neurodegenerative disease (ND) development, and can serve as a protocol
   for the culture of various other types of cells that display
   compatibility with glassy carbon surfaces.},

   Correlations of Evoked Activity in the Neocortex},

Abstract = {Recent analysis of evoked activity recorded across different brain
   regions and tasks revealed a marked decrease in noise correlations and
   trial-by-trial variability. Given the importance of correlations and
   variability for information processing within the rate coding paradigm,
   several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the reduction in these
   quantities despite an increase in firing rates. These models suggest
   that anatomical clusters and/or tightly balanced excitation-inhibition
   can generate intrinsic network dynamics that may exhibit a reduction in
   noise correlations and trial-by-trial variability when perturbed by an
   external input. Such mechanisms based on the recurrent feedback
   crucially ignore the contribution of feedforward input to the statistics
   of the evoked activity. Therefore, we investigated how statistical
   properties of the feedforward input shape the statistics of the evoked
   activity. Specifically, we focused on the effect of input correlation
   structure on the noise correlations and trial-by-trial variability. We
   show that the ability of neurons to transfer the input firing rate,
   correlation, and variability to the output depends on the correlations
   within the presynaptic pool of a neuron, and that an input with even
   weak within-correlations can be sufficient to reduce noise correlations
   and trial-by-trial variability, without requiring any specific recurrent
   connectivity structure. In general, depending on the ongoing activity
   state, feedforward input could either increase or decrease noise
   correlation and trial-by-trial variability. Thus, we propose that evoked
   activity statistics are jointly determined by the feedforward and
   feedback inputs.},

Title = {Neural correlates of visuospatial bias in patients with left hemisphere
   stroke: a causal functional contribution analysis based on game theory},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA},

Abstract = {Stroke patients frequently display spatial neglect, an inability to
   report, or respond to, relevant stimuli in the contralesional space.
   Although this syndrome is widely considered to result from the
   dysfunction of a large-scale attention network, the individual
   contributions of damaged grey and white matter regions to neglect are
   still being disputed. Moreover, while the neuroanatomy of neglect in
   right hemispheric lesions is well studied, the contributions of left
   hemispheric brain regions to visuospatial processing are less well
   understood. To address this question, 128 left hemisphere acute stroke
   patients were investigated with respect to left- and rightward spatial
   biases measured as severity of deviation in the line bisection test and
   as Center of Cancellation (CoC) in the Bells Test. Causal functional
   contributions and interactions of nine predefined grey and white matter
   regions of interest in visuospatial processing were assessed using
   Multi-perturbation Shapley value Analysis (MSA). MSA, an inference
   approach based on game theory, constitutes a robust and exact
   multivariate mathematical method for inferring functional contributions
   from multi-lesion patterns. According to the analysis of performance in
   the Bells test, leftward attentional bias (contralesional deficit) was
   associated with contributions of the left superior temporal gyms and
   rightward attentional bias with contributions of the left inferior
   parietal lobe, whereas the arcuate fascicle was contributed to both
   contra- and ipsilesional bias. Leftward and rightward deviations in the
   line bisection test were related to contributions of the superior
   longitudinal fascicle and the inferior parietal lobe, correspondingly.
   Thus, Bells test and line bisection tests, as well as ipsi- and
   contralesional attentional biases in these tests, have distinct neural
   correlates. Our findings demonstrate the contribution of different grey
   and white matter structures to contra- and ipsilesional spatial biases
   as revealed by left hemisphere stroke. The results provide new insights
   into the role of the left hemisphere in visuospatial processing.},

   properties in shaping the network activity},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {Spike patterns are among the most common electrophysiological
   descriptors of neuron types. Surprisingly, it is not clear how the
   diversity in firing patterns of the neurons in a network affects its
   activity dynamics. Here, we introduce the state-dependent stochastic
   bursting neuron model allowing for a change in its firing patterns
   independent of changes in its input-output firing rate relationship.
   Using this model, we show that the effect of single neuron spiking on
   the network dynamics is contingent on the network activity state. While
   spike bursting can both generate and disrupt oscillations, these
   patterns are ineffective in large regions of the network state space in
   changing the network activity qualitatively. Finally, we show that when
   single-neuron properties are made dependent on the population activity,
   a hysteresis like dynamics emerges. This novel phenomenon has important
   implications for determining the network response to time-varying inputs
   and for the network sensitivity at different operating points.},

Journal = {MICROFLUIDICS AND NANOFLUIDICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We present a novel method to simulate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   for the assessment of slow flow at Reynolds number . We couple Bloch
   equations with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to study the effect
   of flow dynamics at the mesoscopic level on acquired MR images. The
   Bloch equations are used to propagate the evolution of the magnetization
   of particles while their trajectories are being computed simultaneously
   based on DPD interaction forces. The magnetic resonance assessment of
   fluid velocities is performed using a phase-contrast MRI technique,
   implemented by a spin echo single-sided bipolar gradient sequence. The
   computational cost for simulating the fluid flow is successfully reduced
   by an efficient implementation of a vectorized isochromat algorithm. We
   demonstrate successful simulation of laminar flow, flow with diffusion
   effects, and flow around an obstacle. The method can be used to simulate
   convective and diffusive flow MRI experiments at the mesoscopic level.},

Abstract = {In their early days, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were only
   considered as control channel for end users with severe motor
   impairments such as people in the locked-in state. But, thanks to the
   multidisciplinary progress achieved over the last decade, the range of
   BCI applications has been substantially enlarged. Indeed, today BCI
   technology cannot only translate brain signals directly into control
   signals, but also can combine such kind of artificial output with a
   natural muscle-based output. Thus, the integration of multiple
   biological signals for real-time interaction holds the promise to
   enhance a much larger population than originally thought end users with
   preserved residual functions who could benefit from new generations of
   assistive technologies. A BCI system that combines a BCI with other
   physiological or technical signals is known as hybrid BCI (hBCI). In
   this work, we review the work of a large scale integrated project funded
   by the European commission which was dedicated to develop practical
   hybrid BCIs and introduce them in various fields of applications. This
   article presents an hBCI framework, which was used in studies with
   nonimpaired as well as end users with motor impairments.},

Abstract = {Hypersynchronous network activity is the defining hallmark of epilepsy
   and manifests in a wide spectrum of phenomena, of which electrographic
   activity during seizures is only one extreme. The aim of this study was
   to differentiate between different types of epileptiform activity (EA)
   patterns and investigate their temporal succession and interactions. We
   analyzed local field potentials (LFPs) from freely behaving male mice
   that had received an intrahippocampal kainate injection to model mesial
   temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Epileptiform spikes occurred in distinct
   bursts. Using machine learning, we derived a scale reflecting the spike
   load of bursts and three main burst categories that we labeled
   high-load, medium-load, and low-load bursts. We found that bursts of
   these categories were non-randomly distributed in time. High-load bursts
   formed clusters and were typically surrounded by transition phases with
   increased rates of medium-load and low-load bursts. In apparent
   contradiction to this, increased rates of low-load bursts were also
   associated with longer background phases, i.e., periods lacking
   high-load bursting. Furthermore, the rate of low-load bursts was more
   strongly correlated with the duration of background phases than the
   overall rate of epileptiform spikes. Our findings are consistent with
   the hypothesis that low-level EA could promote network stability but
   could also participate in transitions towards major epileptiform events,
   depending on the current state of the network.},

Abstract = {Planning ahead the consequences of future actions is a prototypical
   executive function. In clinical and experimental neuropsychology,
   disc-transfer tasks like the Tower of London (TOL) are commonly used for
   the assessment of planning ability. Previous psychometric evaluations
   have, however, yielded a poor reliability of measuring planning
   performance with the TOL. Based on theory-grounded task analyses and a
   systematic problem selection, the computerized TOL-Freiburg version
   (TOL-F) was developed to improve the task's psychometric properties for
   diagnostic applications. Here, we report reliability estimates for the
   TOL-F from two large samples collected in Mainz, Germany (n = 3,770;
   40-80 years) and in Vienna, Austria (n = 830; 16-84 years). Results show
   that planning accuracy on the TOL-F possesses an adequate internal
   consistency and split-half reliability (> 0.7) that are stable across
   the adult life span while the TOL-F covers a broad range of graded
   difficulty even in healthy adults, making it suitable for both research
   and clinical application.},

Title = {Effects of Spatial Memory Processing on Hippocampal Ripples},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Human High-Frequency-Oscillations (HFO) in the ripple band are
   oscillatory brain activity in the frequency range between 80 and 250 Hz.
   HFOs may comprise different subgroups that either play a role in
   physiologic or pathologic brain functions. An exact differentiation
   between physiologic and pathologic HFOs would help elucidate their
   relevance for cognitive and epileptogenic brain mechanisms, but the
   criteria for differentiating between physiologic and pathologic HFOs
   remain controversial. In particular, the separation of pathologic HFOs
   from physiologic HFOs could improve the identification of epileptogenic
   brain regions during the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy patients.
   In this study, we performed intracranial electroencephalography
   recordings from the hippocampus of epilepsy patients before, during, and
   after the patients completed a spatial navigation task. We isolated
   hippocampal ripples from the recordings and categorized the ripples into
   the putative pathologic group iesRipples, when they coincided with
   interictal spikes, and the putative physiologic group isolRipples, when
   they did not coincide with interictal spikes. We found that the
   occurrence of isolRipples significantly decreased during the task as
   compared to periods before and after the task. The rate of iesRipples
   was not modulated by the task. In patients who completed the spatial
   navigation task on two consecutive days, we furthermore examined the
   occurrence of ripples in the intervening night. We found that the rate
   of ripples that coincided with sleep spindles and were therefore
   putatively physiologic correlated with the performance improvement on
   the spatial navigation task, whereas the rate of all ripples did not
   show this relationship. Together, our results suggest that the
   differentiation of HFOs into putative physiologic and pathologic
   subgroups may help identify their role for spatial memory and memory
   consolidation processes. Conversely, excluding putative physiologic HFOs
   from putative pathologic HFOs may improve the HFO-based identification
   of epileptogenic brain regions in future studies.},

Abstract = {In topology optimization of electromagnetic waves, the Gateaux
   differentiability of the conjugate operator to the complex field
   variable results in the complexity of the adjoint sensitivity, which
   evolves the original real-valued design variable to be complex during
   the iterative solution procedure. Therefore, the self-inconsistency of
   the adjoint sensitivity is presented. To enforce the self-consistency,
   the real part operator has been used to extract the real part of the
   sensitivity to keep the real-value property of the design variable.
   However, this enforced self-consistency can cause the problem that the
   derived structural topology has unreasonable dependence on the phase of
   the incident wave. To solve this problem, this article focuses on the
   self-consistent adjoint analysis of the topology optimization problems
   for electromagnetic waves. This self-consistent adjoint analysis is
   implemented by splitting the complex variables of the wave equations
   into the corresponding real parts and imaginary parts, sequentially
   substituting the split complex variables into the wave equations with
   deriving the coupled equations equivalent to the original wave
   equations, where the infinite free space is truncated by the perfectly
   matched layers. Then, the topology optimization problems of
   electromagnetic waves are transformed into the forms defined on real
   functional spaces instead of complex functional spaces; the adjoint
   analysis of the topology optimization problems is implemented on real
   functional spaces with removing the variational of the conjugate
   operator; the self-consistent adjoint sensitivity is derived, and the
   phase-dependence problem is avoided for the derived structural topology.
   Several numerical examples are implemented to demonstrate the robustness
   of the derived self-consistent adjoint analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Visual mental imagery is the subjective experience of seeing objects or
   events in front of the `inner eye', although they are not actually
   present. Previous research indicates that (1) visual images help to
   remember what has been experienced in the past or when objects need to
   be inspected or manipulated, and (2) visual images are correlated with
   neural activity in early visual cortices, demonstrating a possible
   overlap between visual imagery and visual perception. However, recent
   research revealed that visual imagery can also disrupt cognitive
   processes and impede thinking. In this transcranial magnetic stimulation
   (TMS) experiment, participants had to solve relational reasoning
   problems that varied in their imageability (easy or difficult to
   visualize as a mental image). While solving the problems, eight 10 Hz
   pulses were either applied to primary visual cortex (V1) or a control
   site (Vertex). Our findings suggest a causal link between mental
   imagery, primary visual cortex, and reasoning with visual problems.
   Moreover, participants exhibited much lower error rates when TMS was
   applied to V1. We conclude that the disruption of visual images in
   primary visual cortex can facilitate reasoning.},

Title = {The role of blood vessels in high-resolution volume conductor head
   modeling of EEG},

Abstract = {Reconstruction of the electrical sources of human EEG activity at high
   spatio-temporal accuracy is an important aim in neuroscience and
   neurological diagnostics. Over the last decades, numerous studies have
   demonstrated that realistic modeling of head anatomy improves the
   accuracy of source reconstruction of EEG signals. For example, including
   a cerebro-spinal fluid compartment and the anisotropy of white matter
   electrical conductivity were both shown to significantly reduce modeling
   errors. Here, we for the first time quantify the role of detailed
   reconstructions of the cerebral blood vessels in volume conductor head
   modeling for EEG. To study the role of the highly arborized cerebral
   blood vessels, we created a submillimeter head model based on
   ultra-high-field-strength (7 T) structural MRI datasets. Blood vessels
   (arteries and emissary/intraosseous veins) were segmented using Frangi
   multi-scale vesselness filtering. The final head model consisted of a
   geometry-adapted cubic mesh with over 17 x 10(6) nodes. We solved the
   forward model using a finite-element-method (FEM) transfer matrix
   approach, which allowed reducing computation times substantially and
   quantified the importance of the blood vessel compartment by computing
   forward and inverse errors resulting from ignoring the blood vessels.
   Our results show that ignoring emissary veins piercing the skull leads
   to focal localization errors of approx. 5 to 15 mm. Large errors (>2 cm)
   were observed due to the carotid arteries and the dense arterial
   vasculature in areas such as in the insula or in the medial temporal
   lobe. Thus, in such predisposed areas, errors caused by neglecting blood
   vessels can reach similar magnitudes as those previously reported for
   neglecting white matter anisotropy, the CSF or the dura - structures
   which are generally considered important components of realistic EEG
   head models. Our findings thus imply that including a realistic blood
   vessel compartment in EEG head models will be helpful to improve the
   accuracy of EEG source analyses particularly when high accuracies in
   brain areas with dense vasculature are required. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {In confined microfluidic spaces such as microchannels, electroosmosis is
   a convenient Coulomb-force mechanism used to electrically actuate
   charged particles and ions presented in the fluid and pump the
   electrolytic fluid itself through drag forces. The shape and position of
   electrode pairs, whose induced charges are in contact with the fluid,
   determine the electric field and hence the resulting fluid-dynamic
   velocity distribution. In this paper, we address the inverse design of
   the electrode-pair patterns in such actuation mechanisms. Our approach
   is to use topology optimization to inversely determine the patterns of
   an electrode pair. The optimization procedure requires a mathematical
   description of the desired fluid behaviour, and then drives the patterns
   of the electrode pairs to achieve the goal performance. We demonstrate
   the behaviour of the procedure, which couples the Navier-Stokes
   equations with charge transportation, to implement an efficient
   electroosmotic micromixer for laminar microflow. We show that the
   procedure allows to investigate such microflows under the influence of
   selected parameter variations, thereby exploring the design space
   towards optimal device performance. This developed method is novel on
   the topology optimization of a surface structure to control bulk
   performance and its implementation over a lower-dimensional surface of
   an otherwise volumetric domain, where the material interpolation is
   implemented between Dirichlet and Newmann types of boundary conditions.

Abstract = {Synopsis In many biomimetic approaches, a deep understanding of the
   form-structure-function relationships in living and functionally intact
   organisms, which act as biological role models, is essential. This
   knowledge is a prerequisite for the identification of parameters that
   are relevant for the desired technical transfer of working principles.
   Hence, non-invasive and non-destructive techniques for static (3D) and
   dynamic (4D) high-resolution plant imaging and analysis on multiple
   hierarchical levels become increasingly important. In this study we
   demonstrate that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to resolve
   the plants inner tissue structuring and functioning on the example of
   four plant concept generators with sizes larger than 5 mm used in
   current biomimetic research projects: Dragon tree (Dracaena reflexa var.
   angustifolia), Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), Sugar pine (Pinus
   lambertiana) and Chinese witch hazel (Hamamelis mollis). Two different
   MRI sequences were applied for high-resolution 3D imaging of the
   differing material composition (amount, distribution, and density of
   various tissues) and condition (hydrated, desiccated, and mechanically
   stressed) of the four model organisms. Main aim is to better understand
   their biomechanics, development, and kinematics. The results are used as
   inspiration for developing novel design and fabrication concepts for
   bio-inspired technical fiber-reinforced branchings and smart biomimetic
   actuators.},

Abstract = {Bioelectronic devices have found use at the interface with neural tissue
   to investigate and treat nervous system disorders. Here, the development
   and characterization of a very thin flexible bioelectronic implant
   inserted along the thoracic spinal cord in rats directly in contact with
   and conformable to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord are presented.
   There is no negative impact on hind-limb functionality nor any change in
   the volume or shape of the spinal cord. The bioelectronic implant is
   maintained in rats for a period of 12 weeks. The first subdural
   recordings of spinal cord activity in freely moving animals are
   presented; rats are plugged in via a recording cable and allowed to
   freely behave and move around on a raised platform. Recordings contained
   multiple distinct voltage waveforms spatially localize to individual
   electrodes. This device has great potential to monitor electrical
   signaling in the spinal cord after an injury and in the future, this
   implant will facilitate the identification of biomarkers in spinal cord
   injury and recovery, while enabling the delivery of localized
   electroceutical and chemical treatments.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {118},

Abstract = {The interaction between spontaneous and externally evoked neuronal
   activity is fundamental for a functional brain. Increasing evidence
   suggests that bursts of high-power oscillations in the 15- to 30-Hz
   beta-band represent activation of internally generated events and mask
   perception of external cues. Yet demonstration of the effect of
   beta-power modulation on perception in real time is missing, and little
   is known about the underlying mechanism. Here, we used a closed-loop
   stimulus-intensity adjustment system based on online burst-occupancy
   analyses in rats involved in a forepaw vibrotactile detection task. We
   found that the masking influence of burst occupancy on perception can be
   counterbalanced in real time by adjusting the vibration amplitude.
   Offline analysis of firing rates (FRs) and local field potentials across
   cortical layers and frequency bands confirmed that beta-power in the
   somatosensory cortex anticorrelated with sensory evoked responses.
   Mechanistically, bursts in all bands were accompanied by transient
   synchronization of cell assemblies, but only beta-bursts were followed
   by a reduction of FR. Our closed loop approach reveals that spontaneous
   beta-bursts reflect a dynamic state that competes with external stimuli.},

Title = {Tapered Fibers Combined With a Multi-Electrode Array for Optogenetics in
   Mouse Medial Prefrontal Cortex},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Optogenetics offers many advantages in terms of cell-type specificity,
   allowing to investigate functional connectivity between different brain
   areas at high spatial and neural population selectivity. In order to
   obtain simultaneous optical control and electrical readout of neural
   activity, devices called ``optrodes{''} are employed. They are typically
   composed of a linear array of microelectrodes integrated on a slender
   probe shafts combined with flat-cleaved optical fibers (FF) placed above
   the recording sites. However, due to tissue absorption and scattering,
   light delivered by the FF unevenly illuminates the region of interest.
   This issue is of particular relevance when cellular populations are
   disposed along the dorso-ventral axis, such as in medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) where cortical layers are aligned vertically. The study
   presented here aims at using tapered optical fibers (TFs) in combination
   with a 16-electrode neural probe to better access neural populations
   distributed along the dorso-ventral axis in the mPFC of newborn mice,
   restricting light delivery over a specific portion of the cortical layer
   of interest. Half of the TF surface is coated with a reflecting metal
   blocking the light to enable light delivery from one side of the probe's
   shaft only, with the probe base being designed to host the fiber without
   interfering with the wire-bonds that connect the recording sites to a
   printed circuit board. Monte-Carlo simulations have been implemented to
   define the relative TF-probe position and to identify the light
   intensity distribution above the recording sites. In vivo recordings
   indicate that simultaneous optical stimulation and electrical readout of
   neural activity in the mPFC benefit from the use of the engineered
   TF-based optrode in terms of a more uniform light distribution along the
   dorso-ventral axis and the possibility of restricting light delivery to
   a subset of electrical recording sites of interest.},

Abstract = {Blood coagulation factors can enter the brain under pathological
   conditions that affect the blood-brain interface. Besides their
   contribution to pathological brain states, such as neural
   hyperexcitability, neurodegeneration, and scar formation, coagulation
   factors have been linked to several physiological brain functions. It is
   for example well established that the coagulation factor thrombin
   modulates synaptic plasticity; it affects neural excitability and
   induces epileptic seizures via activation of protease-activated
   receptors in the brain. However, major limitations of current
   experimental and clinical approaches have prevented us from obtaining a
   profound mechanistic understanding of ``neuro-coagulation{''} in health
   and disease. Here, we present how novel human relevant models, i.e.,
   Organ-on-Chips equipped with advanced sensors, can help overcoming some
   of the limitations in the field, thus providing a perspective toward a
   better understanding of neuro-coagulation in brain homeostasis.},

   micro-textures, based on three different tilings of the plane. The
   symmetric tiles of the lattice are regular triangles, quadrangles, and
   hexagons. The goal of the inverse design procedure is to achieve the
   robust Cassie-Baxter state, in which the liquid/vapour interface is
   mathematically described using the Young-Laplace equation on the
   lattice, and a topology optimisation approach is utilised to construct a
   variational problem for the inverse design procedure. Based on numerical
   calculations of the constructed variational problem, underlying effects
   are revealed for several factors, including the Bond number, duty ratio,
   feature size, and lattice constant. The effects of feature size and
   lattice constant provide approaches for compromisingly considering the
   robustness of the Cassie-Baxter mode and manufacturability of the
   inversely designed micro-textures; the effect of the lattice constant
   permits the scaling properties of the derived patterns, and this in turn
   provides an approach to avoid the elasto-capillary instability driven
   collapse of the micro/nanostructures in the derived micro-textures.
   Further, a monolithic inverse design procedure for the periodic
   micro-textures is proposed in the conclusions, with synthetically
   considering the manufacturability as well as contact angle and
   surface-volume ratio of the liquid bulge held by the supported
   liquid/vapour interface. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Researchers from Freiburg University developed an ultraflexible
   fiber-based 3D light delivery system for electrophysiology and
   optogenetic manipulation in freely moving animals. The system allows
   multiside modulation of neuronal activity combined with neuronal
   measurements.
   Simultaneous large-scale recordings and optogenetic interventions may
   hold the key to deciphering the fast-paced and multifaceted dialogue
   between neurons that sustains brain function. Here we have taken
   advantage of thin, cell-sized, optical fibers for minimally invasive
   optogenetics and flexible implantations. We describe a simple procedure
   for making those fibers side-emitting with a Lambertian emission
   distribution. Here we combined those fibers with silicon probes to
   achieve high-quality recordings and ultrafast multichannel optogenetic
   inhibition. Furthermore, we developed a multi-channel optical commutator
   and general-purpose patch-cord for flexible experiments. We demonstrate
   that our framework allows to conduct simultaneous laminar recordings and
   multifiber stimulations, 3D optogenetic stimulation, connectivity
   inference, and behavioral quantification in freely moving animals. Our
   framework paves the way for large-scale photo tagging and controlled
   interrogation of rapid neuronal communication in any combination of
   brain areas.},

Title = {Optogenetic entrainment of neural oscillations with hybrid fiber probes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective. Optogenetic modulation of neural activity is a ubiquitous
   tool for basic-investigation of brain circuits. While the majority of
   optogenetic paradigms rely on short light pulses to evoke synchronized
   activity of optically sensitized cells, many neurobiological processes
   are associated with slow local field potential (LFP) oscillations.
   Therefore, we developed a hybrid fiber probe capable of simultaneous
   electrophysiological recording and optical stimulation and used it to
   investigate the utility of sinusoidal light stimulation for evoking
   oscillatory neural activity in vivo across a broad frequency range.
   Approach. We fabricated hybrid fiber probes comprising a hollow
   cylindrical array of 9 electrodes and a flexible optical waveguide
   integrated within the core. We implanted these probes in the hippocampus
   of transgenic Thyl-ChR2-YFP mice that broadly express the blue-light
   sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) in excitatory neurons
   across the brain. The effects of the sinusoidal light stimulation were
   characterized and contrasted with those corresponding to pulsed
   stimulation in the frequency range of physiological LFP rhythms (3-128
   Hz). Main results. Within hybrid probes, metal electrode surfaces were
   vertically aligned with the waveguide tip, which minimized optical
   stimulation artifacts in neurophysiological recordings. Sinusoidal
   stimulation resulted in reliable and coherent entrainment of LFP
   oscillations up to 70 Hz, the cutoff frequency of ChR2, with response
   amplitudes inversely scaling with the stimulation frequencies.
   Effectiveness of the stimulation was maintained for two months following
   implantation. Significance. Alternative stimulation patterns
   complementing existing pulsed protocols, in particular sinusoidal light
   stimulation, are a prerequisite for investigating the physiological
   mechanisms underlying brain rhythms. So far, studies applying sinusoidal
   stimulation in vivo were limited to single stimulation frequencies. We
   show the feasibility of sinusoidal stimulation in vivo to induce
   coherent LFP oscillations across the entire frequency spectrum supported
   by the gating dynamics of ChR2 and introduce a hybrid fiber probe
   tailored to continuous light stimulation.},

   electrophysiological recordings in freely moving rats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective. Optogenetics involves delivery of light-sensitive opsins to
   the target brain region, as well as introduction of optical and
   electrical devices to manipulate and record neural activity,
   respectively, from the targeted neural population. Combining these
   functionalities in a single implantable device is of great importance
   for a precise investigation of neural networks while minimizing tissue
   damage. Approach. We report on the development, characterization, and in
   vivo validation of a multifunctional optrode that combines a
   silicon-based neural probe with an integrated microfluidic channel, and
   an optical glass fiber in a compact assembly. The silicon probe
   comprises an 11-mu m-wide fluidic channel and 32 recording electrodes
   (diameter 30 mu m) on a tapered probe shank with a length, thickness,
   and maximum width of 7.5 mm, 50 mu m, and 150 mu m, respectively. The
   size and position of fluidic channels, electrodes, and optical fiber can
   be precisely tuned according to the in vivo application. Main results.
   With a total system weight of 0.97 g, our multifunctional optrode is
   suitable for chronic in vivo experiments requiring simultaneous drug
   delivery, optical stimulation, and neural recording. We demonstrate the
   utility of our device in optogenetics by injecting a viral vector
   carrying a ChR2-construct in the prefrontal cortex and subsequent
   photostimulation of the transduced neurons while recording neural
   activity from both the target and adjacent regions in a freely moving
   rat for up to 9 weeks post-implantation. Additionally, we demonstrate a
   pharmacological application of our device by injecting GABA antagonist
   bicuculline in an anesthetized rat brain and simultaneously recording
   the electrophysiological response. Significance. Our triple-modality
   device enables a single-step optogenetic surgery. In comparison to
   conventional multi-step surgeries, our approach achieves higher spatial
   specificity while minimizing tissue damage.},

Abstract = {Microglia constitute the major immune cells that permanently reside in
   the central nervous system (CNS) alongside neurons and other glial
   cells. These resident immune cells are critical for proper brain
   development, actively maintain brain health throughout the lifespan and
   rapidly adapt their function to the physiological or pathophysiological
   needs of the organism. Cutting-edge fate mapping and imaging techniques
   applied to animal models enabled a revolution in our understanding of
   their roles during normal physiological conditions. Here, we highlight
   studies that demonstrate the embryonic yolk sac origin of microglia and
   describe factors, including crosstalk with the periphery and external
   environment, that regulate their differentiation, homeostasis and
   function in the context of healthy CNS. The diversity of microglial
   phenotypes observed across the lifespan, between brain compartments and
   between sexes is also discussed. Understanding what defines specific
   microglial phenotypes is critical for the development of innovative
   therapies to modulate their effector functions and improve clinical
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {The Seventh International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting was
   held May 21-25th, 2018 at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, Pacific
   Grove, California, United States. The interactive nature of this
   conference was embodied by 25 workshops covering topics in BCI (also
   called brain-machine interface) research. Workshops covered foundational
   topics such as hardware development and signal analysis algorithms, new
   and imaginative topics such as BCI for virtual reality and multi-brain
   BCIs, and translational topics such as clinical applications and ethical
   assumptions of BCI development. BCI research is expanding in the
   diversity of applications and populations for whom those applications
   are being developed. BCI applications are moving toward clinical
   readiness as researchers struggle with the practical considerations to
   make sure that BCI translational efforts will be successful. This paper
   summarizes each workshop, providing an overview of the topic of
   discussion, references for additional information, and identifying
   future issues for research and development that resulted from the
   interactions and discussion at the workshop.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Animal behaviour is governed by planning and executing movements. Here,
   using non-stereotypical movements to separate planning and executional
   processes, the authors find evidence for slow processes for planning and
   fast processes for movement execution.
   The smooth conduct of movements requires simultaneous motor planning and
   execution according to internal goals. So far it remains unknown how
   such movement plans are modified without interfering with ongoing
   movements. Previous studies have isolated planning and execution-related
   neuronal activity by separating behavioral planning and movement periods
   in time by sensory cues. Here, we separate continuous self-paced motor
   planning from motor execution statistically, by experimentally
   minimizing the repetitiveness of the movements. This approach shows
   that, in the rat sensorimotor cortex, neuronal motor planning processes
   evolve with slower dynamics than movement-related responses.
   Fast-evolving neuronal activity precees skilled forelimb movements and
   is nested within slower dynamics. We capture this effect via high-pass
   filtering and confirm the results with optogenetic stimulations. The
   various dynamics combined with adaptation-based high-pass filtering
   provide a simple principle for separating concurrent motor planning and
   execution.},

Title = {A Functional Gradient in the Rodent Prefrontal Cortex Supports
   Behavioral Inhibition},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {The ability to plan and execute appropriately timed responses to
   external stimuli is based on a well-orchestrated balance between
   movement initiation and inhibition. In impulse control disorders
   involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) {[}1], this balance is disturbed,
   emphasizing the critical role that PFC plays in appropriately timing
   actions {[}2-4]. Here, we employed optogenetic and electro-physiological
   techniques to systematically analyze the functional role of five key
   subareas of the rat medial PFC (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in
   action control {[}5-9]. Inactivation of mPFC subareas induced drastic
   changes in performance, namely an increase (prelimbic cortex, PL) or
   decrease (infralimbic cortex, IL) of premature responses. Additionally,
   electrophysiology revealed a significant decrease in neuronal activity
   of a PL subpopulation prior to premature responses. In contrast,
   inhibition of OFC subareas (mainly the ventral OFC, i.e., VO)
   significantly impaired the ability to respond rapidly after external
   cues. Consistent with these findings, mPFC activity during response
   preparation predicted trial outcomes and reaction times significantly
   better than OFC activity. These data support the concept of opposing
   roles of IL and PL in directing proactive behavior and argue for an
   involvement of OFC in predominantly reactive movement control. By
   attributing defined roles to rodent PFC sections, this study contributes
   to a deeper understanding of the functional heterogeneity of this brain
   area and thus may guide medically relevant studies of PFC-associated
   impulse control disorders in this animal model for neural disorders

Title = {Effect of edge pruning on structural controllability and observability
   of complex networks},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Controllability and observability of complex systems are vital concepts
   in many fields of science. The network structure of the system plays a
   crucial role in determining its controllability and observability.
   Because most naturally occurring complex systems show dynamic changes in
   their network connectivity, it is important to understand how
   perturbations in the connectivity affect the controllability of the
   system. To this end, we studied the control structure of different types
   of artificial, social and biological neuronal networks (BNN) as their
   connections were progressively pruned using four different pruning
   strategies. We show that the BNNs are more similar to scale-free
   networks than to small-world networks, when comparing the robustness of
   their control structure to structural perturbations. We introduce a new
   graph descriptor, `the cardinality curve', to quantify the robustness of
   the control structure of a network to progressive edge pruning. Knowing

Title = {Distance-dependent inhibition facilitates focality of gamma oscillations
   in the dentate gyrus},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Gamma oscillations (30-150 Hz) in neuronal networks are associated with
   the processing and recall of information. We measured local field
   potentials in the dentate gyrus of freely moving mice and found that
   gamma activity occurs in bursts, which are highly heterogeneous in their
   spatial extensions, ranging from focal to global coherent events.
   Synaptic communication among perisomatic-inhibitory interneurons (PIIs)
   is thought to play an important role in the generation of hippocampal
   gamma patterns. However, how neuronal circuits can generate synchronous
   oscillations at different spatial scales is unknown. We analyzed paired
   recordings in dentate gyrus slices and show that synaptic signaling at
   interneuron-interneuron synapses is distance dependent. Synaptic
   strength declines whereas the duration of inhibitory signals increases
   with axonal distance among interconnected PIIs. Using neuronal network
   modeling, we show that distance-dependent inhibition generates multiple
   highly synchronous focal gamma bursts allowing the network to process
   complex inputs in parallel in flexibly organized neuronal centers.},

Title = {Microglia in brain development and regeneration},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {149},
Number = {8, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It has recently emerged that microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages
   of the central nervous system, play significant noninnate immune roles
   to support the development, maintenance, homeostasis and repair of the
   brain. Apart from being highly specialized brain phagocytes, microglia
   modulate the development and functions of neurons and glial cells
   through both direct and indirect interactions. Thus, recognizing the
   elements that influence the homeostasis and heterogeneity of microglia
   in normal brain development is crucial to understanding the mechanisms
   that lead to early disease pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.
   In this Review, we discuss recent studies that have elucidated the
   physiological development of microglia and summarize our knowledge of
   their non-innate immune functions in brain development and tissue
   repair.},

Abstract = {GABAergic perisoma-inhibiting fast-spiking interneurons (PIIs)
   effectively control the activity of large neuron populations by their
   wide axonal arborizations. It is generally assumed that the output of
   one PII to its target cells is strong and rapid. Here, we show that,
   unexpectedly, both strength and time course of PII-mediated perisomatic
   inhibition change with distance between synaptically connected partners
   in the rodent hippocampus. Synaptic signals become weaker due to lower
   contact numbers and decay more slowly with distance, very likely
   resulting from changes in GABA(A) receptor subunit composition. When
   distance-dependent synaptic inhibition is introduced to a rhythmically
   active neuronal network model, randomly driven principal cell assemblies
   are strongly synchronized by the PIIs, leading to higher precision in
   principal cell spike times than in a network with uniform synaptic
   inhibition.},

Abstract = {One of the fundamental challenges in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is
   to tune a brain signal decoder to reliably detect a user's intention.
   While information about the decoder can partially be transferred between
   subjects or sessions, optimal decoding performance can only be reached
   with novel data from the current session. Thus, it is preferable to
   learn from unlabeled data gained from the actual usage of the BCI
   application instead of conducting a calibration recording prior to BCI
   usage. We review such unsupervised machine learning methods for BCIs
   based on event-related potentials of the electroencephalogram. We
   present results of an online study with twelve healthy participants
   controlling a visual speller. Online performance is reported for three
   completely unsupervised learning methods: (1) learning from label
   proportions, (2) an expectation-maximization approach and (3) MIX, which
   combines the strengths of the two other methods. After a short ramp-up,
   we observed that the MIX method not only defeats its two unsupervised
   competitors but even performs on par with a state-of-the-art regularized
   linear discriminant analysis trained on the same number of data points
   and with full label access. With this online study, we deliver the best
   possible proof in BCI that an unsupervised decoding method can in
   practice render a supervised method unnecessary. This is possible
   de-spite skipping the calibration, without losing much performance and
   with the prospect of continuous improvement over a session. Thus, our
   findings pave the way for a transition from supervised to unsupervised
   learning methods in BCIs based on event-related potentials.},

   distance traveled {[}18], and proximity to spatial boundaries {[}19].
   Whether theta oscillations may also carry a grid-like signal remains
   elusive, however. Capitalizing on previous fMRI studies revealing a
   macroscopic proxy of sum grid cell activity in human entorhinal cortex
   (EC) {[}20-22], we examined intracranial EEG recordings from the EC of
   epilepsy patients (n = 9) performing a virtual navigation task. We found
   that the power of theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) exhibits 6-fold rotational
   modulation by movement direction, reminiscent of grid cell-like
   representations detected using fMRI. Modulation of theta power was
   specific to 6-fold rotational symmetry and to the EC. Hexadirectional
   modulation of theta power by movement direction only emerged during fast
   movements, stabilized over the course of the experiment, and showed
   sensitivity to the environmental boundary. Our results suggest that
   oscillatory power in the theta frequency range carries an imprint of sum
   grid cell activity potentially enabled by a common grid orientation of
   neighboring grid cells {[}23].},

Abstract = {The development of methodology to identify specific cell populations and
   circuits within the basal ganglia is rapidly transforming our ability to
   understand the function of this complex circuit. This mini-symposium
   highlights recent advances in delineating the organization and function
   of neural circuits in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe).
   Although long considered a homogeneous structure in the
   motor-suppressing ``indirect-pathway,{''} the GPe consists of a number
   of distinct cell types and anatomical subdomains that contribute
   differentially to both motor and nonmotor features of behavior. Here, we
   integrate recent studies using techniques, such as viral tracing,
   transgenic mice, electrophysiology, and behavioral approaches, to create
   a revised framework for understanding how the GPe relates to behavior in
   both health and disease.},

Title = {Motor Imagery for Severely Motor-Impaired Patients: Evidence for
   Brain-Computer Interfacing as Superior Control Solution},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) strive to decode brain signals into
   control commands for severely handicapped people with no means of
   muscular control. These potential users of noninvasive BCIs display a
   large range of physical and mental conditions. Prior studies have shown
   the general applicability of BCI with patients, with the conflict of
   either using many training sessions or studying only moderately
   restricted patients. We present a BCI system designed to establish
   external control for severely motor-impaired patients within a very
   short time. Within only six experimental sessions, three out of four
   patients were able to gain significant control over the BCI, which was
   based on motor imagery or attempted execution. For the most affected
   patient, we found evidence that the BCI could outperform the best
   assistive technology (AT) of the patient in terms of control accuracy,
   reaction time and information transfer rate. We credit this success to
   the applied user-centered design approach and to a highly flexible
   technical setup. State-of-the art machine learning methods allowed the
   exploitation and combination of multiple relevant features contained in
   the EEG, which rapidly enabled the patients to gain substantial BCI
   control. Thus, we could show the feasibility of a flexible and
   tailorable BCI application in severely disabled users. This can be
   considered a significant success for two reasons: Firstly, the results
   were obtained within a short period of time, matching the tight clinical
   requirements. Secondly, the participating patients showed, compared to
   most other studies, very severe communication deficits. They were
   dependent on everyday use of AT and two patients were in a locked-in
   state. For the most affected patient a reliable communication was rarely
   possible with existing AT.},

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},

Abstract = {Humans are adept in simultaneously following multiple goals, but the
   neural mechanisms for maintaining specific goals and distinguishing them
   from other goals are incompletely understood. For short time scales,
   working memory studies suggest that multiple mental contents are
   maintained by theta-coupled reactivation, but evidence for similar
   mechanisms during complex behaviors such as goal-directed navigation is
   scarce. We examined intracranial electroencephalography recordings of
   epilepsy patients performing an object-location memory task in a virtual
   environment. We report that large-scale electrophysiological
   representations of objects that cue for specific goal locations are
   dynamically reactivated during goal-directed navigation. Reactivation of
   different cue representations occurred at stimulus-specific hippocampal
   theta phases. Locking to more distinct theta phases predicted better
   memory performance, identifying hippocampal theta phase coding as a
   mechanism for separating competing goals. Our findings suggest shared
   neural mechanisms between working memory and goal-directed navigation
   and provide new insights into the functions of the hippocampal theta
   rhythm.},

Abstract = {In humans, sensorimotor cortical areas receive relevant dopaminergic
   innervation-although an anatomic description of the underlying fiber
   projections is lacking so far. In general, dopaminergic projections
   towards the cortex originate within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and
   are organized in a meso-cortico-limbic system. Using a DTI-based global
   tractography approach, we recently characterized the superolateral
   branch of the medial forebrain bundle (slMFB), a prominent pathway
   providing dopaminergic (and other transmitters) innervation for the
   pre-frontal cortex (Coenen et al., NeuroImage Clin 18:770-783, 2018). To
   define the connections between VTA and sensory-motor cortical fields
   that should contain dopaminergic fibers, we use the slMFB as a key
   structure to lead our fiber selection procedure: using a similar
   tracking-seed and tractography algorithm, we describe a dorsal extension
   of this slMFB that covers sensorimotor fields that are dorsally appended
   to pre-frontal cortical areas. This ``motorMFB{''}, that connects the
   VTA to sensorimotor cortical fields, can be further segregated into
   three sub-bundles with a seed-based fiber-selection strategy: A PFC
   bundle that is attendant to the pre-frontal cortex, passes the lateral
   VTA, runs through the border zone between the posterior and lateral
   ventral thalamic nucleus, and involves the pre- and postcentral gyrus.
   An MB bundle that is attendant to the mammillary bodies runs directly
   through the medial VTA, passes the lateral ventral thalamic nucleus, and
   involves the pre- and postcentral gyrus as well as the supplementary
   motor area (SMA) and the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC). Finally, a BC
   bundle that is attendant to the brainstem and cerebellum runs through
   the lateral VTA, passes the anterior ventral thalamic nucleus, and
   covers the SMA, pre-SMA, and the dPMC. We, furthermore, included a fiber
   tracking of the well-defined dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT) that is
   known to lie in close proximity with respect to fiber orientation and
   projection areas. As expected, the tract is characterized by a
   decussation at the ponto-mesencephal level and a projection covering the
   superior-frontal and precentral cortex. In addition to the physiological
   role of these particular bundles, the physiological and
   pathophysiological impact of dopaminergic signaling within sensorimotor
   cortical fields becomes discussed. However, some limitations have to be
   taken into account in consequence of the method: the transmitter
   content, the directionality, and the occurrence of interposed synaptic
   contacts cannot be specified.},

Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The cortex processes stimuli through a distributed network of
   specialized brain areas. This processing requires mechanisms that can
   route neuronal activity across weakly connected cortical regions.
   Routing models proposed thus far are either limited to propagation of
   spiking activity across strongly connected networks or require distinct
   mechanisms that create local oscillations and establish their coherence
   between distant cortical areas. Here, we propose a novel mechanism which
   explains how synchronous spiking activity propagates across weakly
   connected brain areas supported by oscillations. In our model,
   oscillatory activity unleashes network resonance that amplifies feeble
   synchronous signals and promotes their propagation along weak
   connections ({''}communication through resonance''). The emergence of
   coherent oscillations is a natural consequence of synchronous activity
   propagation and therefore the assumption of different mechanisms that
   create oscillations and provide coherence is not necessary. Moreover,
   the phase-locking of oscillations is a side effect of communication
   rather than its requirement. Finally, we show how the state of ongoing
   activity could affect the communication through resonance and propose
   that modulations of the ongoing activity state could influence
   information processing in distributed cortical networks.},

Abstract = {Objective: Technology for localizing epileptogenic brain regions plays a
   central role in surgical planning. Recent improvements in acquisition
   and electrode technology have revealed that high-frequency oscillations
   (HFOs) within the 80-500 Hz frequency range provide the
   neurophysiologist with new information about the extent of the
   epileptogenic tissue in addition to ictal and interictal lower frequency
   events. Nevertheless, two decades after their discovery there remain
   questions about HFOs as biomarkers of epileptogenic brain and there use
   in clinical practice.
   Methods: In this review, we provide practical, technical guidance for
   epileptologists and clinical researchers on recording, evaluation, and
   interpretation of ripples, fast ripples, and very high-frequency
   oscillations.
   Results: We emphasize the importance of low noise recording to minimize
   artifacts. HFO analysis, either visual or with automatic detection
   methods, of high fidelity recordings can still be challenging because of
   various artifacts including muscle, movement, and filtering.
   Magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)
   recordings are subject to the same artifacts.
   Significance: High-frequency oscillations are promising new biomarkers
   in epilepsy. This review provides interested researchers and clinicians
   with a review of current state of the art of recording and
   identification and potential challenges to clinical translation.},

Abstract = {Biomarkers sensitive to prodromal or early pathophysiological changes in
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms could improve disease detection and
   enable timely interventions. Changes in brain hemodynamics may be
   associated with the main clinical AD symptoms. To test this possibility,
   we measured the variability of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   signal in individuals from three independent datasets (totaling 80 AD
   patients and 90 controls). We detected a replicable increase in brain
   BOLD signal variability in the AD populations, which constituted a
   robust biomarker for clearly differentiating AD cases from controls.
   Fast BOLD scans showed that the elevated BOLD signal variability in AD
   arises mainly from cardiovascular brain pulsations. Manifesting in
   abnormal cerebral perfusion and cerebrospinal fluid convection, present
   observation presents a mechanism explaining earlier observations of
   impaired glymphatic clearance associated with AD in humans.},

Abstract = {Beta oscillations (similar to 13 to 30 Hz) have been observed during
   many perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes in a plethora of brain
   recording studies. Although the function of beta oscillations (hereafter
   ``beta{''} for short) is unlikely to be explained by any single
   monolithic description, we here discuss several convergent findings. In
   prefrontal cortex (PFC), increased beta appears at the end of a trial
   when working memory information needs to be erased. A similar
   ``clear-out{''} function might apply during the stopping of action and
   the stopping of long-term memory retrieval (stopping thoughts), where
   increased prefrontal beta is also observed. A different apparent role
   for beta in PFC occurs during the delay period of working memory tasks:
   it might serve to maintain the current contents and/or to prevent
   interference from distraction. We confront the challenge of relating
   these observations to the large literature on beta recorded from
   sensorimotor cortex. Potentially, the clear-out of working memory in PFC
   has its counterpart in the postmovement clear-out of the motor plan in
   sensorimotor cortex. However, recent studies support alternative
   interpretations. In addition, we flag emerging research on different
   frequencies of beta and the relationship between beta and single-neuron
   spiking. We also discuss where beta might be generated: basal ganglia,
   cortex, or both. We end by considering the clinical implications for
   adaptive deep-brain stimulation.},

Abstract = {Stereo-electroencephalography depth electrodes, regularly implanted into
   drug-resistant patients with focal epilepsy to localize the epileptic
   focus, have a low channel count (6-12 macro- or microelectrodes),
   limited spatial resolution (0.5-1 cm) and large contact area of the
   recording sites (similar to mm(2) ). Thus, they are not suited for
   high-density local field potential and multiunit recordings. In this
   paper, we evaluated the longterm electrophysiological recording
   performance and histocompatibility of a neural interface consisting of
   32 microelectrodes providing a physical shape similar to clinical
   devices. The cylindrically-shaped depth probes made of polyimide (PI)
   were chronically implanted for 13 weeks into the brain of rats, while
   cortical or thalamic activity (local field potentials, single-unit and
   multi-unit activity) was recorded regularly to monitor the temporal
   change of several features of the electrophysiological performance. To
   examine the tissue reaction around the probe, neuron-selective and
   astroglia-selective immunostaining methods were applied. Stable
   single-unit and multi-unit activity were recorded for several weeks with
   the implanted depth probes and a weak or moderate tissue reaction was
   found around the probe track. Our data on biocompatibility presented
   here and in vivo experiments in non-human primates provide a strong
   indication that this type of neural probe can be applied in
   stereo-electroencephalography recordings of up to 2 weeks in humans
   targeting the localization of epileptic foci providing an increased
   spatial resolution and the ability to monitor local field potentials and
   neuronal spiking activity.},

Year = {2020},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests with progressive memory loss and
   spatial disorientation. Neuropathological studies suggest early AD
   pathology in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of young adults at genetic risk
   for AD (APOE epsilon 4-carriers). Because the EC harbors grid cells, a
   likely neural substrate of path integration (PI), we examined PI
   performance in APOE epsilon 4-carriers during a virtual navigation task.
   We report a selective impairment in APOE epsilon 4-carriers specifically
   when recruitment of compensatory navigational strategies via supportive
   spatial cues was disabled. A separate fMRI study revealed that PI
   performance was associated with the strength of entorhinal grid-like
   representations when no compensatory strategies were available,
   suggesting grid cell dysfunction as a mechanistic explanation for PI
   deficits in APOE epsilon 4-carriers. Furthermore, posterior
   cingulate/retrosplenial cortex was involved in the recruitment of
   compensatory navigational strategies via supportive spatial cues. Our
   results provide evidence for selective PI deficits in AD risk carriers,
   decades before potential disease onset.},

Journal = {CELL REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Synchronization has been implicated in neuronal communication, but
   causal evidence remains indirect, We use optogenetics to generate
   depolarizing currents in pyramidal neurons of the cat visual cortex,
   emulating excitatory synaptic inputs under precise temporal control,
   while measuring spike output. The cortex transforms constant excitation
   into strong gamma-band synchronization, revealing the well-known
   cortical resonance. Increasing excitation with ramps increases the
   strength and frequency of synchronization. Slow, symmetric excitation
   profiles reveal hysteresis of power and frequency. White-noise input
   sequences enable causal analysis of network transmission, establishing
   that the cortical gamma-band resonance preferentially transmits coherent
   input components. Models composed of recurrently coupled excitatory and
   inhibitory units uncover a crucial role of feedback inhibition and
   suggest that hysteresis can arise through spike-frequency adaptation,
   The presented approach provides a powerful means to investigate the
   resonance properties of local circuits and probe how these properties
   transform input and shape transmission.},

Title = {Development of an optogenetic toolkit for neural circuit dissection in
   squirrel monkeys},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Optogenetic tools have opened a rich experimental landscape for
   understanding neural function and disease. Here, we present the first
   validation of eight optogenetic constructs driven by recombinant
   adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and a WGA-Cre based dual injection
   strategy for projection targeting in a widely-used New World primate
   model, the common squirrel monkey Saimiri sciureus. We observed opsin
   expression around the local injection site and in axonal projections to
   downstream regions, as well as transduction to thalamic neurons,
   resembling expression patterns observed in macaques. Optical stimulation
   drove strong, reliable excitatory responses in local neural populations
   for two depolarizing opsins in anesthetized monkeys. Finally, we
   observed continued, healthy opsin expression for at least one year.
   These data suggest that optogenetic tools can be readily applied in
   squirrel monkeys, an important first step in enabling precise, targeted
   manipulation of neural circuits in these highly trainable, cognitively
   sophisticated animals. In conjunction with similar approaches in
   macaques and marmosets, optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits in
   squirrel monkeys will provide functional, comparative insights into
   neural circuits which subserve dextrous motor control as well as other
   adaptive behaviors across the primate lineage. Additionally, development
   of these tools in squirrel monkeys, a well-established model system for
   several human neurological diseases, can aid in identifying novel
   treatment strategies.},

Title = {Manipulating Single-Trial Motor Performance in Chronic Stroke Patients
   by Closed-Loop Brain State Interaction},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {1806-1816},
Abstract = {Motor impaired patients performing repetitive motor tasks often reveal
   large single-trial performance variations. Based on a data-driven
   framework, we extracted robust oscillatory brain states from pre-trial
   intervals, which are predictive for the upcoming motor performance on
   the level of single trials. Based on the brain state estimate, i.e.
   whether the brain state predicts a good or bad upcoming performance, we
   implemented a novel gating strategy for the start of trials by selecting
   specifically suitable or unsuitable trial starting time points. In a
   pilot study with four chronic stroke patients with hand motor
   impairments, we conducted a total of 41 sessions. After few initial
   calibration sessions, patients completed approximately 15 hours of
   effective hand motor training during eight online sessions using the
   gating strategy. Patients' reaction times were significantly reduced for
   suitable trials compared to unsuitable trials and shorter overall trial
   durations under suitable states were found in two patients. Overall,
   this successful proof-of-concept pilot study motivates to transfer this
   closed-loop training framework to a clinical study and to other
   application fields, such as cognitive rehabilitation, sport sciences or
   systems neuroscience.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {467-473},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) experiments can
   be simulated by coupling dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) with Bloch
   equations. DPD gives hydrodynamics with thermal fluctuations at a
   well-defined temperature by introducing momentum conserving particle
   interaction forces and a fluctuation dissipation theorem. The Bloch
   equations are a set of differential equations that describe the
   evolution of nuclear magnetization as a function of time. Here we
   successfully simulate DW-MRI by using the solution of Bloch equations
   for each DPD particle while computing its trajectories through DPD
   forces. To this end, a spin echo sequence combined with different
   diffusion-weighting gradients was implemented and tested for the
   diffusion of a fluid bound by different diffusion regimes. Fluid
   confinement was easily incorporated, which enabled investigating
   different diffusion regimes and the performance of different pulse
   sequences. The three different sequences applied were: spin echo
   single-sided bipolar gradient, spin echo two-sided bipolar gradient and
   spin echo uni-polar gradient; and the three imaged diffusion regimes of
   interest were: free diffusion, localization and motional narrowing. (C)

Abstract = {U-Net is a generic deep-learning solution for frequently occurring
   quantification tasks such as cell detection and shape measurements in
   biomedical image data. We present an ImageJ plugin that enables
   non-machine-learning experts to analyze their data with U-Net on either
   a local computer or a remote server/cloud service. The plugin comes with
   pretrained models for single-cell segmentation and allows for U-Net to
   be adapted to new tasks on the basis of a few annotated samples.},

Title = {Mu Opioid Receptors in Gamma-Aminobutyric Acidergic Forebrain Neurons
   Moderate Motivation for Heroin and Palatable Food},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mu opioid receptors (MORs) are central to pain control, drug
   reward, and addictive behaviors, but underlying circuit mechanisms have
   been poorly explored by genetic approaches. Here we investigate the
   contribution of MORs expressed in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic forebrain
   neurons to major biological effects of opiates, and also challenge the
   canonical disinhibition model of opiate reward.
   METHODS: We used Dlx5/6-mediated recombination to create conditional
   Oprm1 mice in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic forebrain neurons. We
   characterized the genetic deletion by histology, electrophysiology, and
   microdialysis; probed neuronal activation by c-Fos immunohistochemistry
   and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; and
   investigated main behavioral responses to opiates, including motivation
   to obtain heroin and palatable food.
   RESULTS: Mutant mice showed MOR transcript deletion mainly in the
   striatum. In the ventral tegmental area, local MOR activity was intact,
   and reduced activity was only observed at the level of striatonigral
   afferents. Heroin-induced neuronal activation was modified at both
   sites, and whole-brain functional networks were altered in live animals.
   Morphine analgesia was not altered, and neither was physical dependence
   to chronic morphine. In contrast, locomotor effects of heroin were
   abolished, and heroin-induced catalepsy was increased. Place preference
   to heroin was not modified, but remarkably, motivation to obtain heroin
   and palatable food was enhanced in operant selfadministration
   procedures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals dissociable MOR functions across
   mesocorticolimbic networks. Thus, beyond a well-established role in
   reward processing, operating at the level of local ventral tegmental
   area neurons, MORs also moderate motivation for appetitive stimuli
   within forebrain circuits that drive motivated behaviors.},

Abstract = {Next-generation neural interfaces for bidirectional communication with
   the central nervous system aim to achieve the intimate integration with
   the neural tissue with minimal neuroinflammatory response, high
   spatio-temporal resolution, very high sensitivity, and readout
   stability. The design and manufacturing of devices for low power/low
   noise neural recording and safe and energy-efficient stimulation that
   are, at the same time, conformable to the brain, with matched mechanical
   properties and biocompatibility, is a convergence area of research where
   neuroscientists, materials scientists, and nanotechnologists operate
   synergically. The biotic-abiotic neural interface, however, remains a
   formidable challenge that prompts for new materials platforms and
   innovation in device layouts. Conductive polymers (CP) are attractive
   materials to be interfaced with the neural tissue and to be used as
   sensing/stimulating electrodes because of their mixed ionic-electronic
   conductivity, their low contact impedance, high charge storage
   capacitance, chemical versatility, and biocompatibility. This manuscript
   reviews the state-of-the-art of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-based
   neural interfaces for extracellular recording and stimulation, focusing
   on those technological approaches that are successfully demonstrated in
   vivo. The aim is to highlight the most reliable and
   ready-for-clinical-use solutions, in terms of materials technology and
   recording performance, other than spot major limitations and identify
   future trends in this field.},

Abstract = {The tunable electrical properties of conducting polymers (CPs), their
   biocompatibility, fabrication versatility, and cost-efficiency make them
   an ideal coating material for stimulation electrodes in biomedical
   applications. Several biological processes like wound healing, neuronal
   regrowth, and cancer metastasis, which rely on constant electric fields,
   demand electrodes capable of delivering direct current stimulation (DCs)
   for long times without developing toxic electrochemical reactions.
   Recently, CPs such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene
   sulfonate (PEDOT/PSS) have demonstrated outstanding capability for
   delivering DCs without damaging cells in culture while not requiring
   intermediate buffers, contrary to the current research setups relying on
   noble-metals and buffering bridges. However, clear understanding of how
   electrode design and CP synthesis influence DCs properties of these
   materials has not been provided until now. This study demonstrates that
   various PEDOT-based CP coatings and hydrogels on rough electrodes can
   deliver DCs without substantial changes to the electrode and the
   noticeable development of chemical by-products depending on the
   electrode area and polymer thickness. A comprehensive analysis of the
   tested coatings is provided according to the desired application and
   available resources, alongside a proposed explanation for the observed
   electrochemical behavior. The CPs tested herein can pave the way toward
   the widespread implementation of DCs as a therapeutic stimulation
   paradigm.},
