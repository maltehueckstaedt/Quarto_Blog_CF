Title = {A universal vector concept for a direct genotyping of transgenic
   organisms and a systematic creation of homozygous lines},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Diploid transgenic organisms are either hemi- or homozygous. Genetic
   assays are, therefore, required to identify the genotype. Our
   AGameOfClones vector concept uses two clearly distinguishable
   transformation markers embedded in interweaved, but incompatible Lox
   site pairs. Cre-mediated recombination leads to hemizygous individuals
   that carry only one marker. In the following generation, heterozygous
   descendants are identified by the presence of both markers and produce
   homozygous progeny that are selected by the lack of one marker. We prove
   our concept in Tribolium castaneum by systematically creating multiple
   functional homozygous transgenic lines suitable for long-term
   fluorescence live imaging. Our approach saves resources and simplifies
   transgenic organism handling. Since the concept relies on the universal
   Cre-Lox system, it is expected to work in all diploid model organisms,
   for example, insects, zebrafish, rodents and plants. With appropriate
   adaptions, it can be used in knock -out assays to preselect homozygous
   individuals and thus minimize the number of wasted animals.},

Title = {Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of Tribolium castaneum
   embryos},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {141},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2331-2338},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of
   metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by
   analyzing a single species, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.
   Embryonic development of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum
   differs fundamentally from that of Drosophila in aspects such as
   short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive
   extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development.
   Although Tribolium has become the second most important insect model
   organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific
   questions and no long-term live imaging data of Tribolium embryogenesis
   have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence
   microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete,
   continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of Tribolium
   embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived
   the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced
   fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the
   rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular
   movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing
   significantly to the understanding of Tribolium development.
   Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of Tribolium
   embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference
   for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that
   serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than
   1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a
   resource for the community. Tribolium is only the second insect species,
   after Drosophila, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live
   imaging has been achieved.},

Abstract = {The insertion of membrane proteins requires proteinaceous complexes in
   the cytoplasm, the membrane, and the lumen of organelles. Most of the
   required complexes have been described, while the components for
   insertion of beta-barrel-type proteins into the outer membrane of
   chloroplasts remain unknown. The same holds true for the signals
   required for the insertion of beta-barrel-type proteins. At present,
   only the processing of Toc75-III, the beta-barrel-type protein of the
   central chloroplast translocon with an atypical signal, has been
   explored in detail. However, it has been debated whether Toc75-V/ outer
   envelope protein 80 (OEP80), a second protein of the same family,
   contains a signal and undergoes processing. To substantiate the
   hypothesis that Toc75-V/OEP80 is processed as well, we reinvestigated
   the processing in a protoplast-based assay as well as in native
   membranes. Our results confirm the existence of a cleavable segment. By
   protease protection and pegylation, we observed intermembrane space
   localization of the soluble N-terminal domain. Thus, Toc75-V contains a
   cleavable N-terminal signal and exposes its polypeptide
   transport-associated domains to the intermembrane space of plastids,
   where it likely interacts with its substrates.},

Abstract = {G-quadruplexes are becoming reliable alternative interaction modules for
   the construction of DNA nanoarchitectures due to their prompt
   inducibility by salts. In this Full Paper, we report the design and
   synthesis of two different DNA minicircles equipped with G-rich
   appendixes that can self-hybridize into a G-quadruplex, which acts as a
   DNA recruiter and glue. Both minicircles, one containing a hairpin-like
   G-rich region and the other an open tuning-fork-like G-rich region, have
   the potential to form DNA G-nanoconstructs but only the tuning-fork
   minicircle does so. Incubation of the tuning-fork minicircle with Na+
   and Ni2+ results in the formation of minicircle dimers, while K+ and
   Sr2+ unexpectedly induce the formation of multimers. Moreover, a
   catenated DNA nanoconstruct is obtained when the components of the
   hairpin minicircle are incubated with K+ or Na+ and assembled in a
   stepwise sequence. All nanoconstructs are visualized by atomic force
   microscopy.},

Abstract = {The interaction between the c(11) ring and the gamma epsilon complex,
   forming the rotor of the Ilyobacter tartaricus ATP synthase, was probed
   by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and in vitro reconstitution
   analysis. The results provide, for the first time, a direct and
   quantitative assessment of the stability of the rotor. The data
   indicated very tight binding between the c(11) ring and the gamma
   epsilon complex, with an apparent K(d) value of approximately 7.4 nM.
   The rotor assembly was primarily dependent on the interaction of the c
   ring with the gamma subunit, and binding of the c ring to the free
   epsilon subunit was not observed. Mutagenesis of selected conserved
   amino acid residues of all three rotor components (cR45, cQ46, gamma
   E204, gamma F203 and epsilon H38) severely affected rotor assembly. The
   interaction kinetics between the gamma epsilon complex and c(11) ring
   mutants suggested that the assembly of the c(11)gamma epsilon complex
   was governed by interactions of low and high affinity. Low-affinity
   binding was observed between the polar loops of the c ring subunits and
   the bottom part of the gamma subunit. High-affinity interactions,
   involving the two residues gamma E204 and epsilon H38, stabilized the
   holo-c(11)gamma epsilon complex. NMR experiments indicated the
   acquisition of conformational order in otherwise flexible C- and
   N-terminal regions of the gamma subunit on rotor assembly. The results
   of this study suggest that docking of the central stalk of the F(1)
   complex to the rotor ring of F(o) to form tight, but reversible,
   contacts provides an explanation for the relative ease of dissociation
   and reconstitution of F(1)F(o) complexes.},

Abstract = {1-D native electrophoresis is used for the separation of individual
   proteins, protein complexes, and supercomplexes. Stable and labile
   protein-protein interactions can be identified depending on detergent
   and buffer conditions. 1-D native gels are immediately applicable for
   in-gel detection of fluorescent-labeled proteins and for in-gel
   catalytic activity assays. 1-D native gels and blots are used to
   determine native mass and oligomeric state of membrane proteins. Protein
   extracts from 1-D native gels are used for generation of antibodies, for
   proteomic work, and for advanced structural investigations. 2-D
   separation of subunits of protein complexes by SDS-PAGE is mostly used
   for immunological and proteomic studies. Following the discussion of
   these general features, specific applications of native electrophoresis
   techniques in various research fields are highlighted: immunological and
   receptor studies, biogenesis and assembly of membrane protein complexes,
   protein import into organelles, dynamics of proteasomes, proteome and
   subproteome investigations, the identification and quantification of
   mitochondrial alterations in apoptosis, carcinogenesis, and
   neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's
   disease, and the vast variety of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.},

Title = {Ambivalent effects of diazoxide on mitochondrial ROS production at
   respiratory chain complexes I and III},

Year = {2009},

Abstract = {Background: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are among the main
   determinants of cellular damage during ischemia and reperfusion. There
   is also ample evidence that mitochondrial ROS production is involved in
   signaling during ischemic and pharmacological preconditioning. In a
   previous study we analyzed the mitochondrial effects of the efficient
   preconditioning drug diazoxide and found that it increased the
   mitochondrial oxidation of the ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye
   2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2DCF) but had no direct impact on the
   H2O2 production of submitochondrial particles (SMP) or intact rat heart
   mitochondria (RHM).
   Methods: H2O2 generation of bovine SMP and tightly coupled RHM was
   monitored under different conditions using the amplex red/horseradish
   peroxidase assay in response to diazoxide and a number of inhibitors.
   Results: We show that diazoxide reduces ROS production by mitochondrial
   complex I under conditions of reverse electron transfer in tightly
   coupled RHM, but stimulates mitochondrial ROS production at the Q(0)
   site of complex III under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction; this
   stimulation is greatly enhanced by uncoupling. These opposing effects
   can both be explained by inhibition of complex 11 by diazoxide.
   5-Hydroxydecanoate had no effect, and the results were essentially
   identical in the presence of Na+ or K+ excluding a role for putative
   mitochondrial K-ATP-channels.
   General significance: A straightforward rationale is presented to
   mechanistically explain the ambivalent effects of diazoxide reported in
   the literature. Depending on the metabolic state and the membrane
   potential of mitochondria, diazoxide-mediated inhibition of complex II
   promotes transient generation of signaling ROS at complex III (during
   preconditioning) or attenuates the production of deleterious ROS at
   complex I (during ischemia and reperfusion). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Robust and automated three-dimensional segmentation of densely packed
   cell nuclei in different biological specimens with Lines-of-Sight
   decomposition},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Background: Due to the large amount of data produced by advanced
   microscopy, automated image analysis is crucial in modern biology. Most
   applications require reliable cell nuclei segmentation. However, in many
   biological specimens cell nuclei are densely packed and appear to touch
   one another in the images. Therefore, a major difficulty of
   three-dimensional cell nuclei segmentation is the decomposition of cell
   nuclei that apparently touch each other. Current methods are highly
   adapted to a certain biological specimen or a specific microscope. They
   do not ensure similarly accurate segmentation performance, i.e. their
   robustness for different datasets is not guaranteed. Hence, these
   methods require elaborate adjustments to each dataset.
   Results: We present an advanced three-dimensional cell nuclei
   segmentation algorithm that is accurate and robust. Our approach
   combines local adaptive pre-processing with decomposition based on
   Lines-of-Sight (LoS) to separate apparently touching cell nuclei into
   approximately convex parts. We demonstrate the superior performance of
   our algorithm using data from different specimens recorded with
   different microscopes. The three-dimensional images were recorded with
   confocal and light sheet-based fluorescence microscopes. The specimens
   are an early mouse embryo and two different cellular spheroids. We
   compared the segmentation accuracy of our algorithm with ground truth
   data for the test images and results from state-of-the-art methods. The
   analysis shows that our method is accurate throughout all test datasets
   (mean F-measure: 91 \%) whereas the other methods each failed for at
   least one dataset (F-measure = 69 \%). Furthermore, nuclei volume
   measurements are improved for LoS decomposition. The state-of-the-art
   methods required laborious adjustments of parameter values to achieve
   these results. Our LoS algorithm did not require parameter value
   adjustments. The accurate performance was achieved with one fixed set of
   parameter values.
   Conclusion: We developed a novel and fully automated three-dimensional
   cell nuclei segmentation method incorporating LoS decomposition. LoS are
   easily accessible features that ensure correct splitting of apparently
   touching cell nuclei independent of their shape, size or intensity. Our
   method showed superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods,
   performing accurately for a variety of test images. Hence, our LoS
   approach can be readily applied to quantitative evaluation in drug
   testing, developmental and cell biology.},

Abstract = {Mechanically interlocked molecules such as rotaxanes and catenanes have
   potential as components of molecular machinery. Rotaxanes consist of a
   dumb-bell-shaped molecule encircled by a macrocycle that can move
   unhindered along the axle, trapped by bulky stoppers. Previously,
   rotaxanes have been made from a variety of molecules, but not from DNA.
   Here, we report the design, assembly and characterization of rotaxanes
   in which both the dumb-bell-shaped molecule and the macrocycle are made
   of double-stranded DNA, and in which the axle of the dumb-bell is
   threaded through the macrocycle by base pairing. The assembly involves
   the formation of pseudorotaxanes, in which the macrocycle and the axle
   are locked together by hybridization. Ligation of stopper modules to the
   axle leads to the characteristic dumb-bell topology. When an
   oligonucleotide is added to release the macrocycle from the axle, the
   pseudorotaxanes are either converted to mechanically stable rotaxanes,
   or they disassemble by means of a slippage mechanism to yield a
   dumb-bell and a free macrocycle. Our DNA rotaxanes allow the fields of
   mechanically interlocked molecules and DNA nanotechnology to be
   combined, thus opening new possibilities for research into molecular
   machines and synthetic biology.},

Title = {Differential Thresholds of Proteasome Activation Reveal Two Separable
   Mechanisms of Sensory Organ Polarization in C. elegans},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Cephalization is a major innovation of animal evolution and implies a
   synchronization of nervous system, mouth, and foregut polarization to
   align alimentary tract and sensomotoric system for effective foraging.
   However, the underlying integration of morphogenetic programs is poorly
   understood. Here, we show that invagination of neuroectoderm through de
   novo polarization and apical constriction creates the mouth opening in
   the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. Simultaneously, all 18 juxta-oral
   sensory organ dendritic tips become symmetrically positioned around the
   mouth: While the two bilaterally symmetric amphid sensilla endings are
   towed to the mouth opening, labial and cephalic sensilla become
   positioned independently. Dendrite towing is enabled by the
   pre-polarized sensory amphid pores intercalating into the leading edge
   of the anteriorly migrating epidermal sheet, while apical
   constriction-mediated cell-cell re-arrangements mediate positioning of
   all other sensory organs. These two processes can be separated by
   gradual inactivation of the 26S proteasome activator, RPN-6.1. Moreover,
   RPN-6.1 also shows a dose-dependent requirement for maintenance of
   coordinated apical polarization of other organs with apical lumen, the
   pharynx, and the intestine. Thus, our data unveil integration of
   morphogenetic programs during the coordination of alimentary tract and
   sensory organ formation and suggest that this process requires tight
   control of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.},

   also in Y lipolytica. Evidence for dimeric complex I suggests further
   association of respiratory supercomplexes into respiratory strings or
   patches. Similar supercomplex organization in Yarrowia and mammalian
   mitochondria further makes this aerobic yeast a useful model for the
   human oxidative phosphorylation system. The analysis of supercomplexes
   and their constituent complexes was made possible by 2-D native
   electrophoresis, i.e. by using native electrophoresis for both
   dimensions. Digitonin and blue-native electrophoresis were generally
   applied for the initial separation of supercomplexes followed by less
   mild native electrophoresis variants in the second dimension to release
   the individual complexes from the supercomplexes. Such 2-D native
   systems are useful means to identify the constituent proteins and their
   copy numbers in detergent-labile physiological assemblies, since they
   can reduce the complexity of supramolecular systems to the level of
   individual complexes.},

Title = {Functional asymmetry and electron flow in the bovine respirasome},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Respirasomes are macromolecular assemblies of the respiratory chain
   complexes I, III and IV in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We
   determined the structure of supercomplex I1III2IV1 from bovine heart
   mitochondria by cryo-EM at 9 angstrom resolution. Most protein-protein
   contacts between complex I, III and IV in the membrane are mediated by
   supernumerary subunits. Of the two Rieske iron-sulfur cluster domains in
   the complex III dimer, one is resolved, indicating that this domain is
   immobile and unable to transfer electrons. The central position of the
   active complex III monomer between complex I and IV in the respirasome
   is optimal for accepting reduced quinone from complex I over a short
   diffusion distance of 11 nm, and delivering reduced cytochrome c to
   complex IV. The functional asymmetry of complex III provides strong
   evidence for directed electron flow from complex I to complex IV through
   the active complex III monomer in the mammalian supercomplex.},

Abstract = {Vibrio cholerae is motile by its polar flagellum, which is driven by a
   Na+-conducting motor. The stators of the motor, composed of four PomA
   and two PomB subunits, provide access for Na+ to the torque-generating
   unit of the motor. To characterize the Na+ pathway formed by the PomAB
   complex, we studied the influence of chloride salts (chaotropic, Na+,
   and K+) and pH on the motility of V. cholerae. Motility decreased at
   elevated pH but increased if a chaotropic chloride salt was added, which
   rules out a direct Na+ and H+ competition in the process of binding to
   the conserved PomB D23 residue. Cells expressing the PomB S26A/T or D42N
   variants lost motility at low Na+ concentrations but regained motility
   in the presence of 170 mM chloride. Both PomA and PomB were modified by
   N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), indicating the presence of
   protonated carboxyl groups in the hydrophobic regions of the two
   proteins. Na+ did not protect PomA and PomB from this modification. Our
   study shows that both osmolality and pH have an influence on the
   function of the flagellum from V. cholerae. We propose that D23, S26,
   and D42 of PomB are part of an ion-conducting pathway formed by the
   PomAB stator complex.},

Title = {A new, sensitive ecto-5 `-nucleotidase assay for compound screening},
Journal = {ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {446},

Abstract = {Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (eN) is a membrane-bound enzyme that hydrolyzes
   extracellular nucleoside-5'-monophosphates yielding the respective
   nucleoside and phosphate. Increased levels of eN expression have been
   observed in many cancer cells. By increasing extracellular adenosine
   concentrations, they contribute to their proliferative, angiogenic,
   metastatic, and immunosuppressive effects. Therefore, eN is of
   considerable interest as a novel drug target for the treatment of cancer
   as well as of inflammatory diseases. In this study, we developed,
   optimized, and applied a highly sensitive radiometric assay using
   {[}H-3]adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP) as a substrate. The reaction
   product {[}H-3]adenosine was separated from {[}H-3]AMP by precipitation
   of the latter with lanthanum chloride and subsequent filtration through
   glass fiber filters. Conditions were optimized to reproducibly collect
   the {[}H-3]adenosine-containing filtrate used for quantitative
   determination. Validation of the assay yielded a mean Z' factor of 0.73,
   which demonstrates its suitability for high-throughput screening. The
   new assay shows a limit of detection that is at least 30-fold lower than
   those of common colorimetric methods (e.g., optimized malachite green
   assay and capillary electrophoresis-based assay procedures), and it is
   also superior to a recently developed luciferase-based assay. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Despite its central function in oxidative phosphorylation, the molecular
   mechanism of proton pumping respiratory complex I is still elusive. In
   recent years, considerable progress has been made towards understanding
   structure/function relationships in this very large and complicated
   membrane protein complex. Last year X-ray crystallographic analysis of
   bacterial and mitochondrial complex I provided important insights into
   its molecular architecture. Based on this evidence, here a hypothetical
   molecular mechanism for redox-driven proton pumping of complex I is
   proposed. According to this mechanism, two pump modules are driven by
   two conformational strokes that are generated by stabilization of the
   anionic forms of semiquinone and ubiquinol that are formed in the
   peripheral arm of complex I during turnover. This results in the
   experimentally determined pumping stoichiometry of 4 H+/2e(-). In the
   two-state model, electron transfer from iron-sulfur cluster N2 is
   allowed only in the `E-state,' while protonation of the substrate is
   only possible in the stabilizing `P-state.' In the membrane arm,
   transition from the E- to the P-state drives the two pump modules via
   long range conformational energy transfer through the recently
   discovered helical transmission element connecting them. The proposed
   two-state stabilization-change mechanism is fully reversible and thus
   inherently explains the operation of complex I in forward and reverse
   mode. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Allosteric
   cooperativity in respiratory proteins. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {rRNA processing and assembly of ribosomal proteins during maturation of
   ribosomes involve many ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs). Recent
   studies identified differences in the set of RBFs in humans and yeast,
   and the existence of plant-specific RBFs has been proposed as well. To
   identify such plant-specific RBFs, we characterized T-DNA insertion
   mutants of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding nuclear proteins with
   nucleotide binding properties that are not orthologues to yeast or human
   RBFs. Mutants of nine genes show an altered rRNA processing ranging from
   inhibition of initial 35S pre-rRNA cleavage to final maturation events
   like the 6S pre-rRNA processing. These phenotypes led to their
   annotation as involved in rRNA processing' - IRP. The irp mutants are
   either lethal or show developmental and stress related phenotypes. We
   identified IRPs for maturation of the plant-specific precursor 5-5.8S
   and one affecting the pathway with ITS2 first cleavage of the 35S
   pre-rRNA transcript. Moreover, we realized that 5-5.8S processing is
   essential, while a mutant causing 6S accumulation shows only a weak
   phenotype. Thus, we demonstrate the importance of the maturation of the
   plant-specific precursor 5-5.8S for plant development as well as the
   occurrence of an ITS2 first cleavage pathway in fast dividing tissues.},

Abstract = {Transcripts of NANOG and OCT4 have been recently identified in human
   t(4;11) leukemia and in a model system expressing both t(4;11) fusion
   proteins. Moreover, downstream target genes of NANOG/OCT4/SOX2 were
   shown to be transcriptionally activated. However, the NANOG1 gene
   belongs to a gene family, including a gene tandem duplication (named
   NANOG2 or NANOGP1) and several pseudogenes (NANOGP2-P11). Thus, it was
   unclear which of the NANOG family members were transcribed in t(4;11)
   leukemia cells. 5'-RACE experiments revealed novel 5'-exons of NANOG1
   and NANOG2, which could give rise to the expression of two different
   NANOG1 and three different NANOG2 protein variants. Moreover, a novel
   PCR-based method was established that allows distinguishing between
   transcripts deriving from NANOG1, NANOG2 and all other NANOG pseudogenes
   (P2-P11). By applying this method, we were able to demonstrate that
   human hematopoietic stem cells and different leukemic cells transcribe
   NANOG2. Furthermore, we functionally tested NANOG1 and NANOG2 protein
   variants by recombinant expression in 293 cells. These studies revealed
   that NANOG1 and NANOG2 protein variants are functionally equivalent and
   activate a regulatory circuit that activates specific stem cell genes.
   Therefore, we pose the hypothesis that the transcriptional activation of
   NANOG2 represents a `gain-of-stem cell function' in acute leukemia.},

   co-purification of two or more protein components using techniques like
   co-immunoprecipitation, tandem affinity purification and native
   electrophoresis. Here we focus on blue-native electrophoresis,
   clear-native electrophoresis, high-resolution clear-native
   electrophoresis and associated techniques to identify stable membrane
   protein complexes and detergent-labile physiological super-complexes.
   Hints for dynamic protein-protein interactions can be obtained using
   two-hybrid techniques but not from native electrophoresis and other
   protein isolation techniques except after covalent cross-linking of
   interacting proteins in vivo prior to protein separation.},

Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {406-411},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Membrane proteins do not work alone. The interaction of proteins with
   membrane lipids can be highly specific and is often important for full
   functional and structural integrity of the protein. Providing the
   appropriate lipid environment is of great importance for the
   purification and crystallisation of membrane proteins. The lipid content
   can be modulated by adjusting purification protocols or by adding back
   native or non-native lipids. Lipids can facilitate crystallisation by
   stabilising the protein and by providing lattice contacts. Of special
   interest is the crystallisation in lipidic cubic phase and with
   bicelles, as they appear to provide a membrane-like environment. These
   strategies have been instrumental for recent successful structure
   determinations of a human G-protein-coupled receptor, the
   beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. Lipid supplementation can also help to
   obtain membrane protein structures in a native conformation, as shown
   for voltage-gated potassium channels. Membrane protein structures,
   especially those derived from lipid-enriched preparations, contain bound
   lipid molecules. Specific protein-lipid interactions not only require
   careful evaluation and interpretation, but also permit a directed
   approach to elucidate the structural and/or functional role of these
   interactions.},

Title = {Novel intracellular functions of apolipoproteins: the ApoO protein
   family as constituents of the Mitofilin/MINOS complex determines cristae
   morphology in mitochondria},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {395},
Number = {3},
Pages = {285-296},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mitochondria exist in a highly dynamic network that is constantly
   altered by fusion and fission events depending on various factors such
   as cellular bioenergetic state and cell cycle. Next to this dynamic
   nature of the organelle, its cristae membrane also undergoes drastic
   morphological changes upon physiological or pathological alterations.
   The Mitofilin/mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS)
   complex was recently reported to ensure mitochondrial architecture and
   crista junction integrity. Several subunits of this complex are linked
   to a diverse set of neurological human disorders. Recently, two
   apolipoproteins, ApoO (APOO) and ApoO-like (APOOL) were suggested to
   represent constituents of the mammalian Mitofilin/MINOS complex. APOOL
   was shown to bind the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) and to
   interact physically with this complex. In this review we highlight the
   current view on the mammalian Mitofilin/MINOS complex and focus on APOOL
   and the role of CL in determining cristae morphology. We will discuss
   possible functions of the Mitofilin/MINOS complex on lipid transport, on
   assembly of respiratory supercomplexes, on F1F0-ATP synthase
   organization, on contact site formation, and on trapping CL within the
   cristae subcompartment.},

Title = {Non-lethal genotyping of Tribolium castaneum adults using genomic DNA
   extracted from wing tissue},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum has become the second most
   important insect model organism and is frequently used in developmental
   biology, genetics and pest-associated research. Consequently, the
   methodological arsenal increases continuously, but many routinely
   applied techniques for Drosophila melanogaster and other insect species
   are still unavailable. For example, a protocol for non-lethal genotyping
   has not yet been adapted but is particularly useful when individuals
   with known genotypes are required for downstream experiments. In this
   study, we present a workflow for non-lethal genotyping of T. castaneum
   adults based on extracting genomic DNA from wing tissue. In detail, we
   describe a convenient procedure for wing dissection and a custom method
   for wing digestion that allows PCR-based genotyping of up to fifty
   adults in less than an afternoon with a success rate of about 86\%. The
   amount of template is sufficient for up to ten reactions while viability
   and fertility of the beetles are preserved. We prove the applicability
   of our protocol by genotyping the white / scarlet gene pair alleles from
   the black-eyed San Bernadino wild-type and whiteeyed Pearl recessive
   mutant strains spanning four generations. Non-lethal genotyping has the
   potential to improve and accelerate many workflows: Firstly, during the
   establishment process of homozygous cultures or during stock keeping of
   cultures that carry recessively lethal alleles, laborious test crossing
   is replaced by non-lethal genotyping. Secondly, in genome engineering
   assays, non-lethal genotyping allows the identification of appropriate
   founders before they are crossed against wild-types, narrowing the
   efforts down to only the relevant individuals. Thirdly, non-lethal
   genotyping simplifies experimental strategies, in which genotype and
   behavior should be correlated, since the genetic configuration of
   potential individuals can be determined before the actual behavior
   assays is performed.},

Abstract = {Biogenesis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a highly
   complex process involving subunits encoded both in the nuclear and the
   organellar genome; in addition, a large number of assembly factors
   participate in this process. The soil bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans
   is an interesting alternative model for the study of COX biogenesis
   events because the number of chaperones involved is restricted to an
   essential set acting in the metal centre formation of oxidase, and the
   high degree of sequence homology suggests the same basic mechanisms
   during early COX assembly. Over the last years, studies on the P.
   denitrificans Surf1 protein shed some light on this important assembly
   factor as a heme a binding protein associated with Leigh syndrome in
   humans. Here, we summarise our current knowledge about Surf1 and its
   role in heme a incorporation events during bacterial COX biogenesis.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY},

Volume = {185},
Number = {3},
Pages = {243-249},

Abstract = {Bacterial replication and chromosome segregation are highly organized
   both in space and in time. However, spatial analysis is hampered by the
   resolution limit of conventional fluorescence microscopy. In this study,
   we incubate rapidly-growing Escherichia coli with
   5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), label the resulting EdU-DNA with
   photoswitchable fluorophores, and image incorporated molecules with an
   average experimental precision of 13 nm. During the segregation process,
   nucleoids develop highly-defined and cell-cycle dependent
   hetero-structures, which contain discrete DNA fibers with diameters far
   below the diffraction limit. Strikingly, these structures appear
   temporally shifted between sister chromosomes, an asymmetry which
   accumulates for ongoing replication rounds. Moreover, nucleoid
   positioning and expansion along the bacterial length axis fit into an
   elongation-mediated segregation model in fast growing E. colt cultures.
   This is supported by close proximity of the nucleoids to the bacterial
   plasma membrane, the nature of the observed hetero-structures and
   recently found interactions of membrane-associated proteins with DNA.

   generally conserved process of ribosome biogenesis. For instance,
   distinct rRNA maturation pathways and intermediates have been
   identified, the existence of plant specific RBFs has been proposed and
   several RBFs are encoded by multiple genes. The latter in combination
   with the discussed ribosome heterogeneity points to a possible function
   of the different proteins representing one RBF in diversification of
   ribosomal compositions. Such factor-based regulation would require a
   differential regulation of their expression, may be even controlled by
   different transcription factors. We analyzed the expression profiles of
   genes coding for putative RBFs and transcription factors. Most of the
   genes coding for RBFs are expressed in a comparable manner, while
   different genes coding for a single RBF are often differentially
   expressed. Based on a selected set of genes we document a function of
   the transcription factors AtMYC1, AtMYC2, AtbHLH105 and AtMYB26 on the
   regulation of different RBFs. Moreover, on the example of the RBFs LSG1
   and BRX1, both encoded by two genes, we give a first hint on a
   differential transcription factor dependence of expression. Consistent
   with this observation, the phenotypic analysis of RBF mutants suggests a
   relation between LSG1-1 and BRX1-1 expression and the transcription
   factor MYC1. In summary, we propose that the multiple genes coding for
   one RBF are required to enlarge the regulatory space for ribosome
   biogenesis.},

Title = {Metalloproteins in the Biology of Heterocysts},
Journal = {LIFE-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic microorganisms present in almost all
   ecologically niches on Earth. They exist as single-cell or filamentous
   forms and the latter often contain specialized cells for N-2 fixation
   known as heterocysts. Heterocysts arise from photosynthetic active
   vegetative cells by multiple morphological and physiological
   rearrangements including the absence of O-2 evolution and CO2 fixation.
   The key function of this cell type is carried out by the metalloprotein
   complex known as nitrogenase. Additionally, many other important
   processes in heterocysts also depend on metalloproteins. This leads to a
   high metal demand exceeding the one of other bacteria in content and
   concentration during heterocyst development and in mature heterocysts.
   This review provides an overview on the current knowledge of the
   transition metals and metalloproteins required by heterocysts in
   heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria. It discusses the molecular,
   physiological, and physicochemical properties of metalloproteins
   involved in N-2 fixation, H-2 metabolism, electron transport chains,
   oxidative stress management, storage, energy metabolism, and metabolic
   networks in the diazotrophic filament. This provides a detailed and
   comprehensive picture on the heterocyst demands for Fe, Cu, Mo, Ni, Mn,
   V, and Zn as cofactors for metalloproteins and highlights the importance
   of such metalloproteins for the biology of cyanobacterial heterocysts.},

Abstract = {Membrane receptors control fundamental cellular processes. Binding of a
   specific ligand to a receptor initiates communication through the
   membrane and activation of signaling cascades. This activation process
   often leads to a spatial rearrangement of receptors in the membrane at

   significantly to the understanding of receptor organization and
   rearrangement in membranes. Here, we review four prominent
   single-molecule techniques that have been applied to membrane receptors,
   namely, stepwise photobleaching, Forster resonance energy transfer,
   sub-diffraction localization microscopy and cotracking. We discuss the
   requirements, benefits and limitations of each technique, discuss target
   labeling, present a selection of applications and results and compare

Abstract = {Mass spectrometry of large macromolecules is still a methodological
   challenge. We here report on the application of the recently developed
   LILBID (laser induced liquid bead ion desorption) mass spectrometry by
   which the biomolecules dissolved in microdroplets are desorbed/ablated
   by a mid-IR laser into vacuum. Two modes of desorption are possible: an
   ultrasoft mode at low laser intensity in which a macromolecule is
   desorbed as integral complex into vacuum and a harsher mode at higher
   intensity, by which it is dissociated into its covalent subunits. With
   this method we studied the soluble core polymerase 11 and a
   membrane-embedded F1Fo-ATP synthase, solubilized by detergent. For both
   complexes the complete complex in different charge state is observed at
   ultrasoft conditions. At elevated laser intensities all 10 subunits
   could be assigned for the core Pol II. In the case of the ATP synthase
   under equal conditions all eight subunits appear in the mass spectrum,
   assigned by a correspondence of the expected theoretical masses of the
   subunits and the observed ones. In addition the method requires only
   sample volumes of microliter at micromolar concentration and is tolerant
   to detergents. Therefore it is a low consumptive method well adapted for
   the mass analysis of biomolecules of low availability such as membrane
   molecules. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Vitamin D in inflammatory diseases},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Changes in vitamin D serum levels have been associated with inflammatory
   diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid
   arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis (MS),
   atherosclerosis, or asthma. Genome- and transcriptome-wide studies
   indicate that vitamin D signaling modulates many inflammatory responses
   on several levels. This includes (i) the regulation of the expression of
   genes which generate pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenases
   or 5-lipoxygenase, (ii) the interference with transcription factors,
   such as NE-kappa B, which regulate the expression of inflammatory genes
   and (iii) the activation of signaling cascades, such as MAP kinases
   which mediate inflammatory responses. Vitamin D targets various tissues
   and cell types, a number of which belong to the immune system, such as
   monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) as well as B- and T cells,
   leading to individual responses of each cell type. One hallmark of these
   specific vitamin D effects is the cell-type specific regulation of genes
   involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes and the interplay
   between vitamin D signaling and other signaling cascades involved in
   inflammation. An important task in the near future will be the
   elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms that are involved in the
   regulation of inflammatory responses by vitamin D on the molecular level
   by the use of techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP),
   ChIP-seq, and FAIRE-seq.},

Title = {Compound heterozygosity for severe and hypomorphic NDUFS2 mutations
   cause non-syndromic LHON-like optic neuropathy},

Abstract = {Background Non-syndromic hereditary optic neuropathy (HON) has been
   ascribed to mutations in mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics genes,
   nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory enzyme genes or
   nuclear genes of poorly known mitochondrial function. However, the
   disease causing gene remains unknown in many families. The objective of
   the present study was to identify the molecular cause of non-syndromic
   LHON-like disease in siblings born to non-consanguineous parents of
   French origin.
   Methods We used a combination of genetic analysis (gene mapping and
   whole-exome sequencing) in a multiplex family of non-syndromic HON and
   of functional analyses in patient-derived cultured skin fibroblasts and
   the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.
   Results We identified compound heterozygote NDUFS2 disease-causing
   mutations (p.Tyr53Cys; p.Tyr308Cys). Studies using patient-derived
   cultured skin fibroblasts revealed mildly decreased NDUFS2 and complex I
   abundance but apparently normal respiratory chain activity. In the yeast
   Y. lipolytica ortholog NUCM, the mutations resulted in absence of
   complex I and moderate reduction in nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, respectively.
   Conclusions Biallelism for NDUFS2 mutations causing severe complex I
   deficiency has been previously reported to cause Leigh syndrome with
   optic neuropathy. Our results are consistent with the view that compound
   heterozygosity for severe and hypomorphic NDUFS2 mutations can cause
   nonsyndromic HON. This observation suggests a direct correlation between
   the severity of NDUFS2 mutations and that of the disease and further
   support that there exist a genetic overlap between non-syndromic and
   syndromic HON due to defective mitochondrial function.},

Title = {On the Structure of the Proton-Binding Site in the F-o Rotor of

Abstract = {The recently reported crystal structures of the membrane-embedded
   proton-dependent c-ring rotors of a cyanobacterial FlFo ATP synthase and
   a chloroplast FlFo ATP synthase have provided new insights into the
   mechanism of this essential enzyme. While the overall features of these
   c-rings are similar, a discrepancy in the structure and hydrogen-bonding
   interaction network of the H+ sites suggests two distinct binding modes,
   potentially reflecting a mechanistic differentiation. Importantly, the
   conformation of the key glutamate side chain to which the proton binds
   is also altered. To investigate the nature of these differences, we use
   molecular dynamics simulations of both c-rings embedded in a
   phospholipid membrane. We observe that the structure of the c(15) ring
   from Spirulina platensis is unequivocally stable within the simulation
   time. By contrast, the proposed structure of the H+ site in the
   chloroplast c(14) ring changes rapidly and consistently into that
   reported for the c(15) ring, indicating that the latter represents a
   common binding mode. To assess this hypothesis, we have remodeled the
   c(14) ring by molecular replacement using the published structure
   factors. The resulting structure provides clear evidence in support of a
   common binding site conformation and is also considerably improved
   statistically. These findings, taken together with a sequence analysis
   of c-subunits in the ATP synthase family, indicate that the so-called
   proton-locked conformation observed in the c(15) ring may be a common
   characteristic not only of light-driven systems such as chloroplasts and
   cyanobacteria but also of a selection of other bacterial species. (C)

Title = {Mitochondrial Targeting Adaptation of the Hominoid-Specific Glutamate
   Dehydrogenase Driven by Positive Darwinian Selection},
Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {4},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many new gene copies emerged by gene duplication in hominoids, but
   little is known with respect to their functional evolution. Glutamate
   dehydrogenase (GLUD) is an enzyme central to the glutamate and energy
   metabolism of the cell. In addition to the single, GLUD-encoding gene
   present in all mammals (GLUD1), humans and apes acquired a second GLUD
   gene (GLUD2) through retroduplication of GLUD1, which codes for an
   enzyme with unique, potentially brain-adapted properties. Here we show
   that whereas the GLUD1 parental protein localizes to mitochondria and
   the cytoplasm, GLUD2 is specifically targeted to mitochondria. Using
   evolutionary analysis and resurrected ancestral protein variants, we
   demonstrate that the enhanced mitochondrial targeting specificity of
   GLUD2 is due to a single positively selected glutamic acid-to-lysine
   substitution, which was fixed in the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting
   sequence (MTS) of GLUD2 soon after the duplication event in the hominoid
   ancestor similar to 18-25 million years ago. This MTS substitution arose
   in parallel with two crucial adaptive amino acid changes in the enzyme
   and likely contributed to the functional adaptation of GLUD2 to the
   glutamate metabolism of the hominoid brain and other tissues. We suggest
   that rapid, selectively driven subcellular adaptation, as exemplified by
   GLUD2, represents a common route underlying the emergence of new gene
   functions.},

Abstract = {Studying the biogenesis of the Thermus thermophilus cytochrome ba(3)
   oxidase, we analyze heme a cofactor insertion into this membrane protein
   complex. Only three proteins linked to oxidase maturation have been
   described for this extreme thermophile, and in particular, no evidence
   for a canonical Surf1 homologue, required for heme a insertion, is
   available from genome sequence data. Here, we characterize the product
   of an open reading frame, cbaX, in the operon encoding subunits of the
   ba(3)-type cytochrome c oxidase. CbaX shares no sequence identity with
   any known oxidase biogenesis factor, and CbaX homologues are found only
   in the Thermaceae group. In a series of cbaX deletion and
   complementation experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting ba(3)
   oxidase complexes, affinity purified via an internally inserted His tag
   located in subunit I, are severely affected in their enzymatic
   activities and heme compositions in both the low-and high-spin sites.
   Thus, CbaX displays typical features of a generic Surf1 factor essential
   for binding and positioning the heme a moiety for correct assembly into
   the protein scaffold of oxidase subunit I.},

Abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters actively move chemically diverse
   substrates across biological membranes. Their malfunction leads to human
   diseases. Many ABC exporters encompass asymmetric nucleotide-binding
   sites (NBSs), and some of them are inhibited by the transported
   substrate. The functional relevance of the catalytic asymmetry or the
   mechanism for trans inhibition remains elusive. Here, we investigated
   TmrAB, a functional homologue of the human antigen translocation complex
   TAP using advanced electron electron double resonance spectroscopy. In
   the presence of ATP, the heterodimeric ABC exporter exists in a tunable
   equilibrium between inward- and outward-facing conformations. The two
   NBSs exhibit pronounced asymmetry in the open-to-close equilibrium. The
   closed conformation is more favored at the degenerate NBS, and dosure of
   either of the NBS is sufficient to open the extracellular gate. We
   define the mechanistic basis for trans-inhibition, which operates by a
   reverse transition from the outward-facing state through an occluded
   conformation. These novel findings uncover the central role of
   reversible conformational equilibrium in the function and regulation of
   an ABC exporter and establish a mechanistic framework for future
   investigations on other medically important transporters with imprinted
   asymmetry. Also, this study demonstrates for the first-time the
   feasibility to resolve equilibrium populations at multiple domains and
   their interdependence for global conformational changes in a large
   membrane protein complex.},

Abstract = {Macromolecular complexes are involved in a broad spectrum of cellular
   processes including protein biosynthesis, protein secretion and
   degradation, metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and signal
   transduction along with other important biological processes. The
   analysis of protein complexes in health and disease is important to gain
   insights into cellular physiology and pathophysiology. In the last few
   decades, research has focused on the identification and the dynamics of
   macromolecular complexes. Several techniques have been developed to
   isolate native protein complexes from cells and tissues to allow further
   characterization by microscopic and proteomic analysis. In the present
   paper, we provide a brief overview of proteomic methods that can be used
   to identify protein-protein interactions, focusing on recent
   developments to study the entire complexome of a biological sample.},

Abstract = {The localization precision is a crucial and important parameter for
   single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) and directly influences
   the achievable spatial resolution. It primarily depends on experimental
   imaging conditions and the registration potency of the algorithm used.
   We propose a new and simple routine to estimate the average experimental
   localization precision in SMLM, based on the nearest neighbor analysis.
   By exploring different experimental and simulated targets, we show that
   this approach can be generally used for any 2D or 3D SMLM data and that
   reliable values for the localization precision sigma (SMLM) are
   obtained. Knowing sigma (SMLM) is a prerequisite for consistent
   visualization or any quantitative structural analysis, e.g., cluster
   analysis or colocalization studies.},

Title = {Acute heat shock leads to cortical domain internalization and polarity
   loss in the C-elegans embryo},
Journal = {GENESIS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {220-228},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many developmental processes are inherently robust due to network
   organization of the participating factors and functional redundancy. The
   heterogeneity of the factors involved and their connectivity puts these
   processes at risk of abrupt system collapse under stress. The
   polarization of the one-cell C. elegans embryo constitutes such an
   inherently robust process with functional redundancy. However, how
   polarization is affected by acute stress has not been thoroughly
   investigated. Here, we report that heat shock (34 degrees C, 1 h)
   triggers a highly reproducible loss of the anterior and collapse of the
   posterior polarity domains. Temperature-dependent loss of cortical
   non-muscle myosin II drastically reduces cortical tension and leads to
   internalization of large plasma membrane domains including the
   membrane-associated polarity factor PAR-2. After internalization, plasma
   membrane vesicles and associated factors cluster around centrosomes and
   are thereby withdrawn from the polarization process. Transient formation
   of the posterior polarity domain suggests that microtubule-induced
   self-organization of this domain is not compromised after heat shock.
   Hence, our data uncover that the polarization system undergoes a
   temperature-dependent collapse under acute stress. genesis, 2016. (c)

Title = {Spiropyran Photoswitches in the Context of DNA: Synthesis and

Journal = {CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL},

Number = {46},
Pages = {15726-15734},

Abstract = {A new design is presented for the incorporation of spiropyran
   photoswitches into nucleic acids by oligonucleotide solid phase
   synthesis. This design enables interaction of the 6-nitrospirobenzopyran
   (NitroBIPS) photoswitch with the adjacent nucleobases and leaves the
   photochemical properties of NitroBIPS intact. UV/Vis spectroscopy and
   HPLC revealed that NitroBIPS incorporated into DNA consists of up to
   40\% merocyanine in its thermal equilibrium and undergoes reversible
   switching between the photoisomeric spiropyran (SP) and merocyanin (MC)
   state by alternating excitation using visible light or heat for at least
   fifteen switching cycles. Exchanging the chromene part of NitroBIPS on
   the DNA level gives access to differently substituted spiropyran
   derivatives allowing the screening for spiropyrans with suitable
   properties in a straightforward manner. Thus, by incorporating the
   highly hydrolysis-stable pyrido-spiropyran derivative PyBIPS pure
   light-triggered reversible switching of a spiropyran in DNA has been
   realized for the first time. Therefore, this design represents a new
   useful platform for investigating the photochromic behavior of different
   spiropyran photoswitches in a nucleic acid environment and for using
   spiropyrans to induce light- or heat-triggered changes in conformations
   or in fluorescence quenching properties of oligonucleotides.},

Abstract = {In light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), only the focal
   plane is illuminated by a laser light sheet. Hence, only the
   fluorophores within a thin volume of the specimen are excited. This
   reduces photo-bleaching and photo-toxic effects by several orders of
   magnitude compared with any other form of microscopy. Therefore, LSFM
   (aka single/selective-plane illumination microscopy {[}SPIM] or
   digitally scanned light sheet microscopy {[}DSLM]) is the technique of
   choice for the three-dimensional imaging of live or fixed and of small
   or large three-dimensional specimens. The parallel recording of millions
   of pixels with modern cameras provides an extremely fast acquisition
   speed. Recent developments address the penetration depth, the resolution
   and the recording speed of LSFM. The impact of LSFM on research areas
   such as three-dimensional cell cultures, neurosciences, plant biology
   and developmental biology is increasing at a rapid pace. The development
   of high-throughput LSFM is the next leap forward, allowing the
   application of LSFM in toxicology and drug discovery screening.},

Abstract = {The study of membrane proteins as prime drug targets has led to
   intensified efforts to characterize their structure and function. With
   regards to the structural analysis of membrane proteins, there have been
   considerable technological innovations in cryo-EM and X-ray
   crystallography, but advancements in the elucidation of membrane protein
   function, especially on a single-molecule level, have been struggling to
   bridge from basic science to high-throughput applications. There is a
   need for advanced biosensor platforms allowing membrane protein-mediated
   transport and potential suppressor libraries to be characterized.
   Membrane proteins facilitating the translocation of non-electrogenic
   substrates particularly suffer from a lack of such techniques to date.
   Here, we summarize recent developments in the field of membrane protein
   analysis, with a special focus on micro- and nanostructured platforms
   for purpose of high-throughput screening using fluorescent read-out
   systems. Additionally, their use as novel biosensor platforms to
   elucidate non-electrogenic substrate translocation is described. This

Abstract = {Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is more prevalent today than
   at any other time in human history. Bedaquiline (BDQ), a novel
   Mycobacterium-specific adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase inhibitor,
   is the first drug in the last 40 years to be approved for the treatment
   of MDR-TB. This bactericidal compound targets the membrane-embedded
   rotor (c-ring) of the mycobacterial ATP synthase, a key metabolic enzyme
   required for ATP generation. We report the x-ray crystal structures of a
   mycobacterial c9 ring without and with BDQ bound at 1.55- and 1.7-A
   degrees resolution, respectively. The structures and supporting
   functional assays reveal how BDQ specifically interacts with the rotor
   ring via numerous interactions and thereby completely covers the
   c-ring's ionbinding sites. This prevents the rotor ring from acting as
   an ion shuttle and stalls ATP synthase operation. The structures explain
   how diarylquinoline chemicals specifically inhibit the mycobacterial ATP
   synthase and thus enable structure-based drug design of next-generation
   ATP synthase inhibitors against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other
   bacterial pathogens.},

Abstract = {Biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a highly complex process
   involving > 30 chaperones in eukaryotes; those required for the
   incorporation of the copper and heme cofactors are also conserved in
   bacteria. Surf1, associated with heme a insertion and with Leigh
   syndrome if defective in humans, is present as two homologs in the soil
   bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans, Surf1c and Surf1q. In an in vitro
   interaction assay, the heme a transfer from purified heme a synthase,
   CtaA, to Surf1c was followed, and both Surf proteins were tested for
   their heme a binding properties. Mutation of four strictly conserved
   amino acid residues within the transmembrane part of each Surf1 protein
   confirmed their requirement for heme binding. Interestingly the mutation
   of a tryptophan residue in transmembrane helix II (W200 in Surf1c and
   W209 in Surf1q) led to a drastic switch in the heme composition, with
   Surf1 now being populated mostly by heme o, the intermediate in the heme
   a biosynthetic pathway. This tryptophan residue discriminates between
   the two heme moieties, apparently coordinates the formyl group of heme
   a, and most likely presents the cofactor in a spatial orientation
   suitable for optimal transfer to its target site within subunit I of
   cytochrome c oxidase.},

Title = {Light Sheet-based Fluorescence Microscopy of Living or Fixed and Stained
   Tribolium castaneum Embryos},
Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {122},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum has become an important insect
   model organism in developmental genetics and evolutionary developmental
   biology. The observation of Tribolium embryos with light sheet-based
   fluorescence microscopy has multiple advantages over conventional
   widefield and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Due to the unique
   properties of a light sheet-based microscope, three dimensional images
   of living specimens can be recorded with high signal-to-noise ratios and
   significantly reduced photo-bleaching as well as photo-toxicity along
   multiple directions over periods that last several days. With more than
   four years of methodological development and a continuous increase of
   data, the time seems appropriate to establish standard operating
   procedures for the usage of light sheet technology in the Tribolium
   community as well as in the insect community at large. This protocol
   describes three mounting techniques suitable for different purposes,
   presents two novel custom-made transgenic Tribolium lines appropriate
   for long-term live imaging, suggests five fluorescent dyes to label
   intracellular structures of fixed embryos and provides information on
   data post-processing for the timely evaluation of the recorded data.
   Representative results concentrate on long-term live imaging, optical
   sectioning and the observation of the same embryo along multiple
   directions. The respective datasets are provided as a downloadable
   resource. Finally, the protocol discusses quality controls for live
   imaging assays, current limitations and the applicability of the
   outlined procedures to other insect species.
   This protocol is primarily intended for developmental biologists who
   seek imaging solutions that outperform standard laboratory equipment. It
   promotes the continuous attempt to close the gap between the technically
   orientated laboratories/communities, which develop and refine microscopy
   methodologically, and the life science laboratories/communities, which
   require `plug-and-play' solutions to technical challenges. Furthermore,
   it supports an axiomatic approach that moves the biological questions
   into the center of attention.},

Title = {Multiscale image analysis reveals structural heterogeneity of the cell
   microenvironment in homotypic spheroids},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Three-dimensional multicellular aggregates such as spheroids provide
   reliable in vitro substitutes for tissues. Quantitative characterization
   of spheroids at the cellular level is fundamental. We present the first
   pipeline that provides three-dimensional, high-quality images of intact
   spheroids at cellular resolution and a comprehensive image analysis that
   completes traditional image segmentation by algorithms from other
   fields. The pipeline combines light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy
   of optically cleared spheroids with automated nuclei segmentation (F
   score: 0.88) and concepts from graph analysis and computational
   topology. Incorporating cell graphs and alpha shapes provided more than
   30 features of individual nuclei, the cellular neighborhood and the
   spheroid morphology. The application of our pipeline to a set of breast
   carcinoma spheroids revealed two concentric layers of different cell
   density for more than 30,000 cells. The thickness of the outer cell
   layer depends on a spheroid's size and varies between 50\% and 75\% of
   its radius. In differently-sized spheroids, we detected patches of
   different cell densities ranging from 5 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(6)
   cells/mm(3). Since cell density affects cell behavior in tissues,
   structural heterogeneities need to be incorporated into existing models.
   Our image analysis pipeline provides a multiscale approach to obtain the
   relevant data for a system-level understanding of tissue architecture.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY OPEN},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1607-1619},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Shrew-1, also called AJAP1, is a transmembrane protein associated with
   E-cadherin-mediated adherence junctions and a putative tumor suppressor.
   Apart from its interaction with beta-catenin and involvement in
   E-cadherin internalization, little structure or function information
   exists. Here we explored shrew-1 expression during postnatal
   differentiation of mammary gland as a model system. Immunohistological
   analyses with antibodies against either the extracellular or the
   cytoplasmic domains of shrew-1 consistently revealed the expression of
   full-length shrew-1 in myoepithelial cells, but only part of it in
   luminal cells. While shrew-1 localization remained unaltered in
   myoepithelial cells, nuclear localization occurred in luminal cells
   during lactation. Based on these observations, we identified two unknown
   shrew-1 transcript variants encoding N-terminally truncated proteins.
   The smallest shrew-1 protein lacks the extracellular domain and is most
   likely the only variant present in luminal cells. RNA analyses of human
   tissues confirmed that the novel transcript variants of shrew-1 exist in
   vivo and exhibit a differential tissue expression profile. We conclude
   that our findings are essential for the understanding and interpretation
   of future functional and interactome analyses of shrew-1 variants.},

Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Crista junctions (CJs) are important for mitochondrial organization and
   function, but the molecular basis of their formation and architecture is
   obscure. We have identified and characterized a mitochondrial membrane
   protein in yeast, Fcj1 (formation of CJ protein 1), which is
   specifically enriched in CJs. Cells lacking Fcj1 lack CJs, exhibit
   concentric stacks of inner membrane in the mitochondrial matrix, and
   show increased levels of F1FO-ATP synthase (F1FO) super-complexes.
   Overexpression of Fcj1 leads to increased CJ formation, branching of
   cristae, enlargement of CJ diameter, and reduced levels of F1FO
   supercomplexes. Impairment of F1FO oligomer formation by deletion of its
   subunits e/g (Su e/g) causes CJ diameter enlargement and reduction of
   cristae tip numbers and promotes cristae branching. Fcj1 and Su e/g
   genetically interact. We propose a model in which the antagonism between
   Fcj1 and Su e/g locally modulates the F1FO oligomeric state, thereby
   controlling membrane curvature of cristae to generate CJs and cristae
   tips.},

Abstract = {During animal development, cells need to sense and adapt to mechanical
   forces from their environment. Ultimately, these forces are transduced
   through the actomyosin cortex. How the cortex simultaneously responds to
   and creates forces during cytokinesis is not well understood. Here we
   show that, under mechanical stress, cortical actomyosin flow can switch
   polarization during cytokinesis in the C. elegans embryo. In unstressed
   embryos, longitudinal cortical flow contributes to contractile ring
   formation, while rotational cortical flow is additionally induced in
   uniaxially loaded embryos, i.e. embryos compressed between two plates.
   Rotational flow depends on astral microtubule signals and is required
   for the redistribution of the actomyosin cortex in loaded embryos.
   Rupture of longitudinally aligned cortical fibers during cortex rotation
   releases tension, initiates orthogonal longitudinal flow and, thereby,
   contributes to furrowing in loaded embryos. Moreover, actomyosin
   regulators involved in RhoA regulation, cortical polarity and chirality
   are all required for rotational flow, and become essential for
   cytokinesis under mechanical stress. In sum, our findings extend the
   current framework of mechanical stress response during cell division and
   show scaling of orthogonal cortical flows to the amount of mechanical
   stress.},

Abstract = {Light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy became an important tool in
   insect developmental biology due to its high acquisition speed, low
   photo-bleaching rate and the high survival probability of the specimens.
   Initially applied to document the embryogenesis of Drosophila
   melanogaster, it is now used to investigate the embryonic morphogenesis
   of emerging model organisms such as the red flour beetle Tribolium
   castaneum. Here, we discuss the principles of light sheet-based
   fluorescence microscopy and outline Tribolium as a model organism for
   developmental biology. We summarize labeling options and present two
   custom-made transgenic lines suitable for live imaging. Finally, we
   highlight studies on Tribolium that address scientific questions with
   fluorescence live imaging and discuss the comparative approach to
   investigate insect morphogenesis in an evolutionary context.},

Abstract = {Plants form new organs with patterned tissue organization throughout
   their lifespan. It is unknown whether this robust post-embryonic organ
   formation results from stereotypic dynamic processes, in which the
   arrangement of cells follows rigid rules. Here, we combine modeling with
   empirical observations of whole-organ development to identify the
   principles governing lateral root formation in Arabidopsis. Lateral
   roots derive from a small pool of founder cells in which some take a
   dominant role as seen by lineage tracing. The first division of the
   founders is asymmetric, tightly regulated, and determines the formation
   of a layered structure. Whereas the pattern of subsequent cell divisions
   is not stereotypic between different samples, it is characterized by a
   regular switch in division plane orientation. This switch is also
   necessary for the appearance of patterned layers as a result of the
   apical growth of the primordium. Our data suggest that lateral root
   morphogenesis is based on a limited set of rules. They determine cell
   growth and division orientation. The organ-level coupling of the cell
   behavior ensures the emergence of the lateral root's characteristic
   features. We propose that self-organizing, non-deterministic modes of
   development account for the robustness of plant organ morphogenesis.},

Abstract = {Mitochondrial complex I is a 1 MDa membrane protein complex with a
   central role in aerobic energy metabolism. The bioenergetic core
   functions are executed by 14 central subunits that are conserved from
   bacteria to man. Despite recent progress in structure determination, our
   understanding of the function of the similar to 30 accessory subunits
   associated with the mitochondrial complex is still limited. We have
   investigated the structure of complex I from the aerobic yeast Yarrowia
   lipolytica by cryo-electron microscopy. Our density map at 7.9 angstrom
   resolution closely matches the 3.6-3.9 angstrom X-ray structure of the
   Yarrowia lipolytica complex. However, the cryo-EM map indicated an
   additional subunit on the side of the matrix arm above the membrane
   surface, pointing away from the membrane arm. The density, which is not
   present in any previously described complex I structure and occurs in
   about 20 \% of the particles, was identified as the accessory sulfur
   transferase subunit ST1. The Yarrowia lipolytica complex I preparation
   is active in generating H2S from the cysteine derivative
   3-mercaptopyruvate, catalyzed by ST1. We thus provide evidence for a
   link between respiratory complex I and mitochondrial sulfur metabolism.

Abstract = {The insertion of organellar membrane proteins with the correct topology
   requires the following: First, the proteins must contain topogenic
   signals for translocation across and insertion into the membrane.
   Second, proteinaceous complexes in the cytoplasm, membrane, and lumen of
   organelles are required to drive this process. Many complexes required
   for the intracellular distribution of membrane proteins have been
   described, but the signals and components required for the insertion of
   plastidic beta-barrel-type proteins into the outer membrane are largely
   unknown. The discovery of common principles is difficult, as only a few
   plastidic beta-barrel proteins exist. Here, we provide evidence that the
   plastidic outer envelope beta-barrel proteins OEP21, OEP24, and OEP37
   from pea (Pisum sativum) and Arabidopsis thaliana contain information
   defining the topology of the protein. The information required for the
   translocation of pea proteins across the outer envelope membrane is
   present within the six N-terminal beta-strands. This process requires
   the action of translocon of the outer chloroplast (TOC) membrane. After
   translocation into the intermembrane space, beta-barrel proteins
   interact with TOC75-V, as exemplified by OEP37 and P39, and are
   integrated into the membrane. The membrane insertion of plastidic
   beta-barrel proteins is affected by mutation of the last beta-strand,
   suggesting that this strand contributes to the insertion signal. These
   findings shed light on the elements and complexes involved in plastidic
   beta-barrel protein import.},

Abstract = {The guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathway facilitates
   targeting and insertion of tail-anchored proteins into membranes. In
   plants, such a protein insertion machinery for the endoplasmic reticulum
   as well as constituents within mitochondrial and chloroplasts were
   discovered. Previous phylogenetic analysis revealed that Get3 sequences
   of Embryophyta form two clades representing cytosolic ({''}a{''}) and
   organellar ({''}bc{''}) GET3 homologs, respectively. Cellular
   fractionation of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and usage of the
   self-assembly GFP system in protoplasts verified the cytosolic
   ((AT)Get3a), plastidic ((AT)Get3b) and mitochondrial ((AT)Get3c)
   localization of the different homologs. The identified plant homologs of
   Getl and Get4 in A. thaliana are localized in ER and cytosol,
   respectively, implicating a degree of conservation of the GET pathway in
   A. thaliana. Transient expression of Get3 homologs of Solanurn
   lycopersicum, Medicago x varia or Physcomitrella patens with the
   self-assembly GFP technique in homologous and heterologous systems
   verified that multiple Get3 homologs with differing subcellular
   localizations are common in plants. Chloroplast localized Get3 homologs
   were detected in all tested plant systems. In contrast, mitochondrial
   localized Get3 homologs were not identified in S. lycopersicum, or P.
   patens, while we confirmed on the example of A. thaliana proteins that
   mitochondrial localized Get3 proteins are properly targeted in S.
   lycopersicum as well.},

Pages = {529-546},
Abstract = {Autophagy can act either as a tumor suppressor or as a survival
   mechanism for established tumors. To understand how autophagy plays this
   dual role in cancer, in vivo models are required. By using a highly
   heterogeneous C. elegans germline tumor, we show that autophagy-related
   proteins are expressed in a specific subset of tumor cells, neurons.
   Inhibition of autophagy impairs neuronal differentiation and increases
   tumor cell number, resulting in a shorter life span of animals with
   tumors, while induction of autophagy extends their life span by
   impairing tumor proliferation. Fasting of animals with fully developed
   tumors leads to a doubling of their life span, which depends on modular
   changes in transcription including switches in transcription factor
   networks and mitochondrial metabolism. Hence, our results suggest that
   metabolic restructuring, cell-type specific regulation of autophagy and
   neuronal differentiation constitute central pathways preventing growth
   of heterogeneous tumors.},

Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We solved the crystal structure of a novel type of c-ring isolated from
   Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 at 2.5 angstrom, revealing a cylinder with a
   tridecameric stoichiometry, a central pore, and an overall shape that is
   distinct from those reported thus far. Within the groove of two
   neighboring c-subunits, the conserved glutamate of the outer helix
   shares the proton with a bound water molecule which itself is
   coordinated by three other amino acids of outer helices. Although none
   of the inner helices contributes to ion binding and the glutamate has no
   other hydrogen bonding partner than the water oxygen, the site remains
   in a stable, ion-locked conformation that represents the functional
   state present at the c-ring/membrane interface during rotation. This
   structure reveals a new, third type of ion coordination in ATP
   synthases. It appears in the ion binding site of an alkaliphile in which
   it represents a finely tuned adaptation of the proton affinity during
   the reaction cycle.},

Abstract = {The membrane-embedded rotors of Na+-dependent F-ATP synthases comprise
   11 c-subunits that form a ring, with 11 Na+ binding sites in between
   adjacent subunits. Following an updated crystallographic analysis of the
   c-ring from Ilyobacter tartaricus, we report the complete
   ion-coordination structure of the Na+ sites. In addition to the four
   residues previously identified, there exists a fifth ligand, namely, a
   buried structural water molecule. This water is itself coordinated by
   Thr67, which, sequence analysis reveals, is the only residue involved in
   binding that distinguishes Na+ synthases from H+-ATP synthases known to
   date. Molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations of the
   c-ring in a lipid membrane lend clear support to the notion that this
   fifth ligand is a water molecule, and illustrate its influence on the
   selectivity of the binding sites. Given the evolutionary ascendancy of
   sodium over proton bioenergetics, this structure uncovers an ancient
   strategy for selective ion coupling in ATP synthases. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {A simple and fast method of lipid analysis of isolated intact
   mitochondria by means of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is described.
   Mitochondria isolated from bovine heart and yeast have been employed to
   set up and validate the new method of lipid analysis. The mitochondrial
   suspension is directly applied over the target and, after drying,
   covered by a thin layer of the 9-aminoacridine matrix solution. The
   lipid profiles acquired with this procedure contain all peaks previously
   obtained by analyzing the lipid extracts of isolated mitochondria by TLC
   and/or mass spectrometry. The novel procedure allows the quick, simple,
   precise, and accurate analysis of membrane lipids, utilizing only a tiny
   amount of isolated organelle; it has also been tested with intact
   membranes of the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans for its evolutionary
   link to present-day mitochondria.(Jlr) The method is of general validity
   for the lipid analysis of other cell fractions and isolated organelles.

Abstract = {Formation of the anteroposterior and dorsoventral body axis in
   Caenorhabditis elegans depends on cortical flows and advection of
   polarity determinants. The role of this patterning mechanism in tissue
   polarization after formation of cell-cell contacts is not fully
   understood. Here, we demonstrate that planar asymmetries are established
   during left-right symmetry breaking: Centripetal cortical flows
   asymmetrically and differentially advect anterior polarity determinants
   (aPARs) from contacts to the medial cortex, resulting in their unmixing
   from apical myosin. Contact localization and advection of PAR-6 requires
   balanced CDC-42 activation, while asymmetric retention and advection of
   PAR-3 can occur independently of PAR-6. Concurrent asymmetric retention
   of PAR-3, E-cadherin/HMR-1 and opposing retention of antagonistic CDC-42
   and Wnt pathway components leads to planar asymmetries. The most obvious
   mark of planar asymmetry, retention of PAR-3 at a single cell-cell
   contact, is required for proper cytokinetic cell intercalation. Hence,
   our data uncover how planar polarity is established in a system without
   the canonical planar cell polarity pathway through planar asymmetric
   retention of aPARs.},

Abstract = {Dysregulation of the basal autophagic flux has been linked to several

   screening assay in which the autophagic flux is measured by recording
   the fluorescence emission of the tandem fusion protein mRFP-GFP-LC3 by
   dynamic live-cell imaging. We optimized the assay for the identification
   of autophagy modulators in three dimensions with U343 glioma cell
   spheroids, which represent a more realistic cancer model than
   conventional 2D cell cultures. We validated the assay by screening a
   library of known autophagy modulators. As the first application, a small
   library of 94 natural compounds was screened for its impact on
   autophagy. We discovered the cyclic ionophore nonactin as a new and
   potent autophagy inducer. This novel autophagy screening assay based on
   3D tumor spheroids is robust, reproducible, and scalable. It provides a
   valuable tool for both basic research and drug screening campaigns.},

Abstract = {In spite of their relatively low fluorescence quantum yield, cyanine
   dyes such as Cy3, Cy5, or Cy7 are widely used in single-molecule
   fluorescence applications due to their high extinction coefficients and
   excellent photon yields. We show that the fluorescence quantum yield and
   lifetime of red-emitting cyanine dyes can be substantially increased in
   heavy water (D2O) compared with water (H2O). We find that the magnitude
   of the quantum yield increase in D2O scales with the emission
   wavelength, reaching a particularly high value of 2.6-fold for the most
   red-emitting dye investigated, Cy7. We further demonstrate a higher
   photon yield in single-molecule superresolution experiments in D2O
   compared to H2O, which leads to an improved localization precision and
   hence better spatial resolution. This finding is especially beneficial
   for biological applications of fluorescence microscopy, which are
   typically carried out in aqueous media and which greatly profit from the
   red spectral range due to reduced cellular auto-fluorescence.},

Abstract = {Tribolium castaneum has become an important insect model organism for

   few protocols for live fluorescence imaging of Tribolium have been
   reported, and little image data is available. Here we provide a protocol
   for recording the development of Tribolium embryos with
   light-sheet-based fluorescence microscopy. The protocol can be completed
   in 4-7 d and provides procedural details for: embryo collection,
   microscope configuration, embryo preparation and mounting, noninvasive
   live imaging for up to 120 h along multiple directions, retrieval of the
   live embryo once imaging is completed, and image data processing, for
   which exemplary data is provided. Stringent quality control criteria for
   developmental biology studies are also discussed. Light-sheet-based
   fluorescence microscopy complements existing toolkits used to study
   Tribolium development, can be adapted to other insect species, and
   requires no advanced imaging or sample preparation skills.},

Abstract = {P>Infant acute leukaemia is characterised by specific genetic
   rearrangements and a rapid onset of disease shortly after birth. The
   vast majority of these cases bear rearranged MLL alleles. However, many
   facets of MLL-rearranged leukaemia are largely unknown. Basically, there
   exists a fundamental and evolutionary conserved relationship between the
   family of MLL/Trithorax proteins and the regulation of HOX gene
   clusters. Therefore, direct MLL fusion proteins are per se able to
   deregulate HOX genes, except when reciprocal MLL fusion proteins come
   into play. This reviews discusses (i) the current situation in
   MLL-rearranged leukaemia, (ii) the molecular and genetic tools to
   functionally investigate the many different MLL fusions, (iii) the
   latency of disease development, (iv) a novel cancer mechanism that has
   been recently uncovered when different MLL fusion protein complexes were
   characterized, (v) mutated signalling pathways in MLL-rearranged
   leukaemia and (vi) presents new ideas on how a given MLL fusion protein
   may modulate existing signalling pathways in leukaemic cells. The
   hypothesis is posed that the many different fusion partners of MLL are
   critically distinct entities for which specific inhibitors should be
   identified in the future.},

Title = {APOOL Is a Cardiolipin-Binding Constituent of the Mitofilin/MINOS
   Protein Complex Determining Cristae Morphology in Mammalian Mitochondria},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Mitochondrial cristae morphology is highly variable and altered under
   numerous pathological conditions. The protein complexes involved are
   largely unknown or only insufficiently characterized. Using complexome
   profiling we identified apolipoprotein O (APOO) and apolipoprotein
   O-like protein (APOOL) as putative components of the Mitofilin/MINOS
   protein complex which was recently implicated in determining cristae
   morphology. We show that APOOL is a mitochondrial membrane protein
   facing the intermembrane space. It specifically binds to cardiolipin in
   vitro but not to the precursor lipid phosphatidylglycerol.
   Overexpression of APOOL led to fragmentation of mitochondria, a reduced
   basal oxygen consumption rate, and altered cristae morphology.
   Downregulation of APOOL impaired mitochondrial respiration and caused
   major alterations in cristae morphology. We further show that APOOL
   physically interacts with several subunits of the MINOS complex, namely
   Mitofilin, MINOS1, and SAMM50. We conclude that APOOL is a
   cardiolipin-binding component of the Mitofilin/MINOS protein complex
   determining cristae morphology in mammalian mitochondria. Our findings
   further assign an intracellular role to a member of the apolipoprotein
   family in mammals.},

Title = {Quality control of mitochondria during aging: Is there a good and a bad

Abstract = {Maintenance of functional mitochondria is essential in order to prevent
   degenerative processes leading to disease and aging. Mitochondrial
   dynamics plays a crucial role in ensuring mitochondrial quality but may
   also generate and spread molecular damage through a population of
   mitochondria. Computational simulations suggest that this dynamics is
   advantageous when mitochondria are not or only marginally damaged. In
   contrast, at a higher degree of damage, mitochondrial dynamics may be
   disadvantageous. Deceleration of fusion-fission cycles could be one way
   to adapt to this situation and to delay a further decline in
   mitochondrial quality. However, this adaptive response makes the
   mitochondrial network more vulnerable to additional molecular damage.
   The mitochondrial infectious damage adaptation (MIDA) model explains a
   number of inconsistent and counterintuitive data such as the clonal
   expansion of mutant mitochondrial DNA. We propose that mitochondrial
   dynamics is a double-edged sword and suggest ways to test this
   experimentally.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE},

Volume = {59},
Pages = {106-118},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Neurotransmitter release as well as the structural and functional
   dynamics of the presynaptic active zone is controlled by proteinaceous
   components. Here we describe for the first time an experimental approach
   for the isolation of the presynaptic active zone from individual mouse
   brains, a prerequisite for understanding the functional inventory of the
   presynaptic protein network and for the later analysis of changes
   occurring in mutant mice. Using a monoclonal antibody against the
   ubiquitous synaptic vesicle protein SV2 we immunopurified synaptic
   vesicles docked to the presynaptic plasma membrane. Enrichment studies
   by means of Western blot analysis and mass spectrometry identified 485
   proteins belonging to an impressive variety of functional categories.
   Our data suggest that presynaptic active zones represent focal hot spots
   that are not only involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release
   but also in multiple structural and functional alterations the adult
   nerve terminal undergoes during neural activity in adult CNS. They
   furthermore open new avenues for characterizing alterations in the
   active zone proteome of mutant mice and their corresponding controls,
   including the various mouse models of neurological diseases. (C) 2014

Title = {Probing the limits of liquid droplet laser desorption mass spectrometry
   in the analysis of oligonucleotides and nucleic acids},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {In the present work we demonstrate the advantages of LILBID mass
   spectrometry (laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption) in the analysis
   of nucleic acids and large oligonucleotides. For established methods
   like matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDD and electrospray
   ionization (ESI), the mass analysis of oligonucleotides or of
   noncovalent oligonucleotide-protein complexes, in particular of very
   large ones, still represents a considerable challenge either due to the
   lack of native solutions or nonspecific adduct formation or due to a
   reduced salt tolerance or a high charge state of the ions. With LILBID,
   oligonucleotides, solvated in micro-droplets of aqueous buffer at
   certain pH and ion strength, are brought into the gas phase by laser
   ablation. We show that our method is able to detect single- and
   double-stranded oligonucleotides with high softness, demonstrated by the
   buffer dependence of the melting of a duplex. The absolute sensitivity
   is in the attomole range concomitant with a total analyte consumption in
   the femtomole region. The upper mass limit of oligonucleotides still
   detected with good signal-to-noise ratio with LILBID is the 1.66MDa
   plasmid pUC19. With DNA ladders from short duplexes with sticky ends, we
   show that LILBID correctly reflects the relative thermodynamic
   stabilities of the ladders. Moreover, as an example for a specific
   DNA-protein complex we show that a NF-kappa B p50 homodimer binds
   sequence specifically to its match DNA. In summary we demonstrate that
   LILBID, although presently performed only with low mass resolution, due
   to these advantages, is an alternative mass spectrometric method for the
   analysis of oligonucleotides in general and of specific noncovalent
   nucleic acid-protein complexes in particular. Copyright (C) 2009 John

Title = {The Pathophysiology of H2S in Renal Glomerular Diseases},
Journal = {BIOMOLECULES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Renal glomerular diseases such as glomerulosclerosis and diabetic
   nephropathy often result in the loss of glomerular function and
   consequently end-stage renal disease. The glomerulus consists of
   endothelial cells, mesangial cells and glomerular epithelial cells also
   referred to as podocytes. A fine-tuned crosstalk between glomerular
   cells warrants control of growth factor synthesis and of matrix
   production and degradation, preserving glomerular structure and
   function. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) belongs together with nitric oxide (NO)
   and carbon monoxide (CO) to the group of gasotransmitters. During the
   last three decades, these higher concentration toxic gases have been
   found to be produced in mammalian cells in a well-coordinated manner.
   Recently, it became evident that H2S and the other gasotransmitters
   share common targets as signalling devices that trigger mainly
   protective pathways. In several animal models, H2S has been demonstrated
   as a protective factor in the context of kidney disorders, in particular
   of diabetic nephropathy. Here, we focus on the synthesis and action of
   H2S in glomerular cells, its beneficial effects in the glomerulus and
   its action in the context of the other gaseous signalling molecules NO
   and CO.},

Title = {Gasotransmitter synthesis and signalling in the renal glomerulus.
   Implications for glomerular diseases},
Journal = {CELLULAR SIGNALLING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {77},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Glomerular injury is a hallmark of kidney diseases such as diabetic
   nephropathy, IgA nephropathy or other forms of glomerulonephritis.
   Glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, glomerular epithelial
   cells (podocytes) and, in an inflammatory context, infiltrating immune
   cells crosstalk to mediate signalling processes in the glomerulus. Under
   physiological conditions, mesangial cells act by the control of
   extracellular matrix production and degradation, by the synthesis of
   growth factors and by preserving a well-defined crosstalk with
   glomerular podocytes and endothelial cells to regulate glomerular
   structure and function. It is well known that mesangial cells are able
   to amplify an inflammatory process by the formation of cytokines,
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). This exaggerated
   reaction may result in a vicious cycle with subsequent damage of
   neighboured podocytes and endothelial cells, loss of the filtration
   barrier and, finally destruction of the whole glomerulus. Unfortunately,
   all efforts to develop new therapies for the treatment of glomerular
   diseases by controlling unbridled ROS or NO production directly had so
   far no success. However, on-going research on ROS and NO defined these
   autacoids more as important signalling molecules than as endogenously
   produced cytotoxic compounds. New findings on signalling activities of
   ROS, NO but also hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon monoxide (CO)
   supported this paradigm shift. Because of their similar chemical
   properties and their similar signal transduction capacities, NO, H2S and
   CO are meanwhile designated as the group of gasotransmitters. In this
   review, we describe the current knowledge of the signalling properties
   of gasotransmitters with a focus on glomerular cells and their role in
   glomerular diseases.},

Abstract = {Protein complexes from the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system are
   assembled with the help of proteins called assembly factors. We here
   delineate the function of the inner mitochondrial membrane protein
   TMEM70, in which mutations have been linked to OXPHOS deficiencies,
   using a combination of BioID, complexome profiling and coevolution
   analyses. TMEM70 interacts with complex I and V and for both complexes
   the loss of TMEM70 results in the accumulation of an assembly
   intermediate followed by a reduction of the next assembly intermediate
   in the pathway. This indicates that TMEM70 has a role in the stability
   of membrane-bound subassemblies or in the membrane recruitment of
   subunits into the forming complex. Independent evidence for a role of
   TMEM70 in OXPHOS assembly comes from evolutionary analyses. The
   TMEM70/TMEM186/TMEM223 protein family, of which we show that TMEM186 and
   TMEM223 are mitochondrial in human as well, only occurs in species with
   OXPHOS complexes. Our results validate the use of combining complexome
   profiling with BioID and evolutionary analyses in elucidating congenital
   defects in protein complex assembly.},

Abstract = {During the last decades, small inorganic molecules like reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and even the
   highly toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) have been evolved as important
   signaling molecules that trigger crucial cellular processes by
   regulating the activity of kinases, phosphatases and transcription
   factors. These redox molecules use similar target structures and
   therefore, the composition of the complex ``redox environment{''}
   determines the final outcome of signaling processes and may subsequently
   also affect the behavior of a cell in an inflammatory environment. Here,
   we discuss the role of H2S in this complex interplay with a focus on the
   transcription factors Nrf2 and NF kappa B. (C)2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Single cell super-resolution imaging of E. coli OmpR during
   environmental stress},
Journal = {INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1297-1308},
Abstract = {Two-component signaling systems are a major strategy employed by
   bacteria, and to some extent, yeast and plants, to respond to
   environmental stress. The EnvZ/OmpR system in E. coli responds to
   osmotic and acid stress and is responsible for regulating the protein
   composition of the outer membrane. EnvZ is a histidine kinase located in
   the inner membrane. Upon activation, it is autophosphorylated by ATP and
   subsequently, it activates OmpR. Phosphorylated OmpR binds with high
   affinity to the regulatory regions of the ompF and ompC porin genes to
   regulate their transcription. We set out to visualize these
   two-components in single bacterial cells during different environmental
   stress conditions and to examine the subsequent modifications to the
   bacterial nucleoid as a result. We created a chromosomally-encoded,
   active, fluorescent OmpR-PAmCherry fusion protein and compared its
   expression levels with RNA polymerase. Quantitative western blotting had
   indicated that these two proteins were expressed at similar levels. From
   our images, it is evident that OmpR is significantly less abundant
   compared to RNA polymerase. In cross-sectional axial images, we observed
   OmpR molecules closely juxtaposed near the inner membrane during acidic
   and hyposomotic growth. In acidic conditions, the chromosome was
   compacted. Surprisingly, under acidic conditions, we also observed
   evidence of a spatial correlation between the DNA and the inner
   membrane, suggesting a mechanical link through an active DNA-OmpR-EnvZ
   complex. This work represents the first direct visualization of a
   response regulator with respect to the bacterial chromosome.},

Abstract = {Antibiotic therapy in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections
   targets de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which is orchestrated by a 1.9
   MDa type I fatty acid synthase (FAS). Here, we characterize M.
   tuberculosis FAS by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and
   interpret the data by docking the molecular models of yeast and
   Mycobacterium smegmatis FAS. Our analysis reveals a porous barrel-like
   structure of considerable conformational variability that is illustrated
   by the identification of several conformational states with altered
   topology in the multienzymatic assembly. This demonstrates that the
   barrel-like structure of M. tuberculosis FAS is not just a static
   scaffold for the catalytic domains, but may play an active role in
   coordinating fatty acid synthesis. The conception of M. tuberculosis FAS
   as a highly dynamic assembly of domains revises the view on bacterial
   type I fatty acid synthesis and might inspire new strategies for
   inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis in M. tuberculosis.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Structured illumination microscopy relies on reconstruction algorithms
   to yield super-resolution images. Artifacts can arise in the
   reconstruction and affect the image quality. Current reconstruction
   methods involve a parametrized apodization function and a Wiener filter.
   Empirically tuning the parameters in these functions can minimize
   artifacts, but such an approach is subjective and produces volatile
   results. We present a robust and objective method that yields optimal
   results by two straightforward filtering steps with
   Richardson-Lucy-based deconvolutions. We provide a resource to identify
   artifacts in 2D-SIM images by analyzing two main reasons for artifacts,
   out-of-focus background and a fluctuating reconstruction spectrum. We
   show how the filtering steps improve images of test specimens,
   microtubules, yeast and mammalian cells.},

Abstract = {Collybistin (Cb) is a brain-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor,
   which interacts with the inhibitory receptor anchoring protein gephyrin.
   In the hippocampus of constitutively Cb-deficient adult mice, gephyrin
   and gephyrin-dependent GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are lost front
   postsynaptic sites. Here, we used a Cre-loxP system to inactivate the Cb
   gene in the forebrain at different develop men tal stages. Deletion of
   Cb during embryonic development prevented gephyrin Clustering during
   synaptogenesis and caused an accumulation of gephyrin aggregates in the
   cell body of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Inactivation of the Cb gene during
   the third postnatal week resulted in a protracted loss of postsynaptic
   gephyrin clusters and the appearance of cytoplasmic gephyrin aggregates.
   These changes in gephyrin distribution were accompanied by a similar
   reduction in synaptically localized GABA(A)R gamma 2-subunit
   immunoreactivity. Our data show that Cb is required for both the initial
   localization and maintenance of gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent GABAARs
   at inhibitory postsynaptic membrane specializations in the hippocampus.

Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Mitochondrial complex I is the largest integral membrane enzyme of the
   respiratory chain and consists of 44 different subunits encoded in the
   mitochondrial and nuclear genome. Its biosynthesis is a highly
   complicated and multifaceted process involving at least 14 additional
   assembly factors. How these subunits assemble into a functional complex
   I and where the assembly factors come into play is largely unknown.
   Here, we applied a dynamic complexome profiling approach to elucidate
   the assembly of human mitochondrial complex I and its further
   incorporation into respiratory chain supercomplexes. We delineate the
   stepwise incorporation of all but one subunit into a series of distinct
   assembly intermediates and their association with known and putative
   assembly factors, which had not been implicated in this process before.
   The resulting detailed and comprehensive model of complex I assembly is
   fully consistent with recent structural data and the remarkable modular
   architecture of this multiprotein complex.},

Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Animal development relies on repeated symmetry breaking, e.g., during
   axial specification, gastrulation, nervous system lateralization, lumen
   formation, or organ coiling. It is crucial that asymmetry increases
   during these processes, since this will generate higher morphological
   and functional specialization. On one hand, cue-dependent symmetry
   breaking is used during these processes which is the consequence of
   developmental signaling. On the other hand, cells isolated from
   developing animals also undergo symmetry breaking in the absence of
   signaling cues. These spontaneously arising asymmetries are not well
   understood. However, an ever growing body of evidence suggests that
   these asymmetries can originate from spontaneous symmetry breaking and
   self-organization of molecular assemblies into polarized entities on
   mesoscopic scales. Recent discoveries will be highlighted and it will be
   discussed how actomyosin and microtubule networks serve as common
   biomechanical systems with inherent abilities to drive spontaneous
   symmetry breaking.},

Title = {EphrinB2 controls vessel pruning through STAT1-JNK3 signalling},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Angiogenesis produces primitive vascular networks that need pruning to
   yield hierarchically organized and functional vessels. Despite the
   critical importance of vessel pruning to vessel patterning and function,
   the mechanisms regulating this process are not clear. Here we show that
   EphrinB2, a well-known player in angiogenesis, is an essential regulator
   of endothelial cell death and vessel pruning. This regulation depends
   upon phosphotyrosine-EphrinB2 signalling repressing c-jun N-terminal
   kinase 3 activity via STAT1. JNK3 activation causes endothelial cell
   death. In the absence of JNK3, hyaloid vessel physiological pruning is
   impaired, associated with abnormal persistence of hyaloid vessels,
   defective retinal vasculature and microphthalmia. This syndrome closely
   resembles human persistent hyperplastic primary vitreus (PHPV),
   attributed to failed involution of hyaloid vessels. Our results provide
   evidence that EphrinB2/STAT1/JNK3 signalling is essential for vessel
   pruning, and that defects in this pathway may contribute to PHPV.},

Title = {Intramembrane Proteolysis of Mgm1 by the Mitochondrial Rhomboid Protease
   Is Highly Promiscuous Regarding the Sequence of the Cleaved Hydrophobic
   Segment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {401},

Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Rhomboids are a family of intramembrane serine proteases that are
   conserved in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. They are required for
   numerous fundamental cellular functions such as quorum sensing, cell
   signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondrial rhomboids form an
   evolutionarily distinct class of rhomboids. It is largely unclear how
   their activity is controlled and which substrate determinants are
   responsible for recognition and cleavage. We investigated these
   requirements for the mitochondrial rhomboid protease Pcp1 and its
   substrate Mgm1. In contrast to several other rhomboid proteases, Pcp1
   does not require helix-breaking amino acids in the cleaved hydrophobic
   region of Mgm1, termed `rhomboid cleavage region' (RCR). Even
   transmembrane segments of inner membrane proteins that are normally not
   processed by Pcp1 become cleavable when put in place of the authentic
   RCR of Mgm1. We further show that mutational alterations of a highly
   negatively charged region located C-terminally to the RCR led to a
   strong processing defect. Moreover, we show that the determinants
   required for Mgm1 processing by mitochondrial rhomboid protease are
   conserved during evolution, as PARL (the human ortholog of Pcp1) showed
   similar substrate requirements. These results suggest a surprising
   promiscuity of the mitochondrial rhomboid protease regarding the
   sequence requirements of the cleaved hydrophobic segment. We propose a
   working hypothesis on how the mitochondrial rhomboid protease can,
   despite this promiscuity, achieve a high specificity in recognizing
   Mgm1. This hypothesis relates to the exceptional biogenesis pathway of
   Mgm1. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The cytochrome bc(1) complex is a key component in several respiratory
   pathways. One of the characteristics of the eukaryotic complex is the
   presence of a small acidic subunit, which is thought to guide the
   interaction of the complex with its electron acceptor and facilitate
   electron transfer. Paracoccus denitrificans represents the only example
   of a prokaryotic organism in which a highly acidic domain is covalently
   fused to the cytochrome c(1) subunit. In this work, a deletion variant
   lacking this acidic domain has been produced and purified by affinity
   chromatography. The complex is fully intact as shown by its X-ray
   structure, and is a dimer (Kleinschroth et al., subm.) compared to the
   tetrameric (dimer-of-dimer) state of the wild-type. The variant complex
   is studied by steady-state kinetics and flash photolysis, showing wild
   type turnover and a virtually identical interaction with its substrate
   cytochrome c(552). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Asparagine 131, located near the cytoplasmic entrance of the D-pathway
   in subunit I of the Paracoccus denitrificans aa(3) cytochrome c oxidase,
   is a residue crucial for proton pumping: When replaced by an aspartate,
   the mutant enzyme is completely decoupled: while retaining full
   cytochrome c oxidation activity, it does not pump protons. The same
   phenotype is observed for two other substitutions at this position
   (N131E and N131C), whereas a conservative replacement by glutamine
   affects both activities of the enzyme. The N131D variant oxidase was
   crystallized and its structure was solved to A resolution, revealing no
   significant overall change in the protein 2.32-angstrom structure when
   compared with the wild type (WT), except for an alternative orientation
   of the E278 side chain in addition to its WT conformation. Moreover,
   remarkable differences in the crystallographically resolved chain of
   water molecules in the D-pathway are found for the variant: four water
   molecules that are observed in the water chain between N131. and E278 in
   the WT structure are not visible in the variant, indicating a higher
   mobility of these water molecules. Electrochemically induced Fourier
   transform infrared difference spectra of decoupled mutants confirm that
   the protonation state of E278 is unaltered by these mutations but
   indicate a distinct perturbation in the hydrogen-bonding environment of
   this residue. Furthermore, they suggest that the carboxylate side chain
   of the N131D mutant is deprotonated. These findings are discussed in
   terms of their mechanistic implications for proton routing through the
   D-pathway of cytochrome c oxidase. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Mitochondria are double-membrane enclosed eukaryotic organelles with a
   central role in numerous cellular functions. The ultrastructure of
   mitochondria varies considerably between tissues, organisms, and the
   physiological state of cells. Alterations and remodeling of inner
   membrane structures are evident in numerous human disorders and during
   apoptosis. The inner membrane is composed of two subcompartments, the
   cristae membrane and the inner boundary membrane. Recent advances in
   electron tomography led to the current view that these membrane domains
   are connected by rather small tubular structures, termed crista
   junctions. They have been proposed to regulate the dynamic distribution
   of proteins and lipids as well as of soluble metabolites between
   individual mitochondrial subcompartments. One example is the release of
   cytochrome c upon induction of apoptosis. However, only little is known
   on the molecular mechanisms mediating the formation and maintenance of
   cristae and crista junctions. Here we review the current knowledge of
   the factors that determine cristae morphology and how the latter is
   linked to mitochondrial function. Further, we formulate several
   theoretical models which could account for the de novo formation of
   cristae as well as their propagation from existing cristae. (C) 2008

Title = {The non-glycosylated isoform of MIC26 is a constituent of the mammalian

Abstract = {Mitochondrial membrane architecture is important for organelle function.
   Alterations thereof are linked to a number of human disorders including
   diabetes and cardiomyopathy. The MICOS complex was recently reported to
   be a central player determining cristae structure and formation of
   crista junctions. Here we investigated the functional role of MIC26, a
   lipoprotein formerly termed APOO. Its levels are increased in diabetic
   heart tissue and in blood plasma of patients suffering from acute
   coronary syndrome. We demonstrate that human MIC26 exists in three
   distinct forms: (1) a glycosylated and secreted 55 kDa protein,,(2) an
   ER/Golgi-resident form thereof, and (3) a non-glycosylated 22 kDa
   mitochondrial protein. The latter isoform spans the mitochondrial inner
   membrane and physically interacts with several MICOS complex subunits
   such as MIC60, MIC27, and MIC10. We further demonstrate that MIC26 and
   MIC27, a homologous protein formerly termed APOOL, regulate their levels
   in an antagonistic manner. Both proteins are positively correlated with
   the levels of MIC10 as well as tafazzin, an enzyme required for
   cardiolipin remodeling. Overexpression of MIC26 induced fragmentation of
   mitochondria, promoted ROS formation and resulted in impaired
   mitochondrial respiration. Downregulation of MIC26 induced a decrease in
   mitochondrial oxygen consumption, whereas mitochondrial network
   morphology and ROS levels remained unaffected. MIC26 depletion led to
   alterations in mitochondrial ultrastructure and caused a significant
   reduction in the number of crista junctions. In summary, we show that
   the human apolipoprotein MIC26 is a bona fide subunit of the MICOS
   complex and that MIC26 is linked to cardiolipin metabolism and promotes
   crista junction formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Domain rotation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) between the
   cytochrome (cyt) b and cyt c(1) redox centers plays a key role in the
   mechanism of the cyt bc(1) complex. Electron transfer within the cyt
   bc(1) complex of Paracoccus denitrificans was studied using a ruthenium
   dimer to rapidly photo-oxidize cyt c(1) within 1 mu s and initiate the
   reaction. In the absence of any added quinol or inhibitor of the bc(1)
   complex at pH 8.0, electron transfer from reduced ISP to cyt c(1) was
   biphasic with rate constants of K-lf = 6300 +/- 3000 s(-1) and k(ls) =
   640 +/- 300 s(-1) and amplitudes of 10 +/- 3\% and 16 +/- 4\% of the
   total amount of cyt c(1) photooxidized. Upon addition of any of the P-m
   type inhibitors MOA-stilbene, myxothiazol, or azoxystrobin to cyt bc(1)
   in the absence of quinol, the total amplitude increased 2-fold,
   consistent with a decrease in redox potential of the ISP. In addition,
   the relative amplitude of the fast phase increased significantly,
   consistent with a change in the dynamics of the ISP domain rotation. In
   contrast, addition of the Pf type inhibitors JG-144 and famoxadone
   decreased the rate constant k(lf) by 5-10-fold and increased the
   amplitude over 2-fold. Addition of quinol substrate in the absence of
   inhibitors led to a 2-fold increase in the amplitude of the k(lf) phase.
   The effect of QH(2) on the kinetics of electron transfer from reduced
   ISP to cyt c(1) was thus similar to that of the P-m inhibitors and very
   different from that of the P-f inhibitors. The current results indicate
   that the species occupying the Q(o) site has a significant
   conformational influence on the dynamics of the ISP domain rotation.},

Abstract = {An intriguing feature of mitochondrial complex I from several species is
   the so-called A/D transition, whereby the idle enzyme spontaneously
   converts from the active (A) form to the de-active (D) form. The A/D
   transition plays an important role in tissue response to the lack of
   oxygen and hypoxic deactivation of the enzyme is one of the key
   regulatory events that occur in mitochondria during ischaemia. We
   demonstrate for the first time that the A/D conformational change of
   complex I does not affect the macromolecular organisation of
   supercomplexes in vitro as revealed by two types of native
   electrophoresis. Cysteine 39 of the mitochondrially-encoded ND3 subunit
   is known to become exposed upon de-activation. Here we show that even if
   complex I is a constituent of the I + III2 + IV (S-1) supercomplex,
   cysteine 39 is accessible for chemical modification in only the D-form.
   Using lysine-specific fluorescent labelling and a DICE-like approach we
   further identified two new subunits involved in structural
   rearrangements during the A/D transition: ND1 (MT-ND1) and 39 kDa
   (NDUFA9). These results clearly show that structural rearrangements
   during de-activation of complex I include several subunits located at
   the junction between hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, in the region
   of the quinone binding site. De-activation of mitochondrial complex I
   results in concerted structural rearrangement of membrane subunits which
   leads to the disruption of the sealed quinone chamber required for
   catalytic turnover. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   (EVP4593) as a highly potent inhibitor of the multisubunit membrane
   protein. EVP4593 specifically and effectively reduces the mitochondrial
   complex I-dependent respiration with no effect on the respiratory chain
   complexes II-IV. Similar to established Q-site inhibitors, EVP4593
   elicits the release of reactive oxygen species at the flavin site of
   mitochondrial complex I. Recently, EVP4593 was nominated as a lead
   compound for the treatment of Huntingtons disease. Our results challenge
   the postulated primary mode-of-action of EVP4593 as an inhibitor of
   NF-kappa B pathway activation and/or store-operated calcium influx.},

Abstract = {The investigation of non-coding RNAs requires RNAs containing
   modifications at every possible position within the oligonucleotide.
   Here, we present the chemo-enzymatic RNA synthesis containing
   photoactivatable or C-13,N-15-labelled nucleosides. All four
   ribonucleotides containing ortho-nitrophenylethyl (NPE) photocages,
   photoswitchable azobenzene C-nucleotides and C-13,N-15-labelled
   nucleotides were incorporated position-specifically in high yields. We
   applied this approach for the synthesis of light-inducible 2'dG-sensing
   riboswitch variants and detected ligand-induced structural
   reorganization upon irradiation by NMR spectroscopy. This
   chemo-enzymatic method opens the possibility to incorporate a wide range
   of modifications at any desired position of RNAs of any lengths beyond
   the limits of solid-phase synthesis.},

Title = {A New Type of Na+-Driven ATP Synthase Membrane Rotor with a
   Two-Carboxylate Ion-Coupling Motif},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum uses glutamate
   decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of Na+. Here, we
   demonstrate that this ion-motive force is directly coupled to ATP
   synthesis, via an F1Fo-ATP synthase with a novel Na+ recognition motif,
   shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free-energy
   simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicate
   Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity
   measurements showed Na+ stimulation of the enzyme, either
   membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to the
   Na+ ionophore monensin. Furthermore, Na+ has a protective effect against
   inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites, both in the complete ATP
   synthase and the isolated c-ring. Definitive evidence of Na+ coupling is
   provided by two identical crystal structures of the c(11) ring, solved
   by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 and 2.6 angstrom resolution, at pH 5.3
   and 8.7, respectively. Na+ ions occupy all binding sites, each
   coordinated by four amino acids and a water molecule. Intriguingly, two
   carboxylates instead of one mediate ion binding. Simulations and
   experiments demonstrate that this motif implies that a proton is
   concurrently bound to all sites, although Na+ alone drives the rotary
   mechanism. The structure thus reveals a new mode of ion coupling in ATP
   synthases and provides a basis for drug-design efforts against this
   opportunistic pathogen.},

Abstract = {Mitochondrial complex I has a key role in cellular energy metabolism,
   generating a major portion of the proton motive force that drives
   aerobic ATP synthesis. The hydrophilic arm of the L-shaped similar to 1
   MDa membrane protein complex transfers electrons from NADH to
   ubiquinone, providing the energy to drive proton pumping at distant
   sites in the membrane arm. The critical steps of energy conversion are
   associated with the redox chemistry of ubiquinone. We report the cryo-EM
   structure of complete mitochondrial complex I from the aerobic yeast
   Yarrowia lipolytica both in the deactive form and after capturing the
   enzyme during steady-state activity. The site of ubiquinone binding
   observed during turnover supports a two-state stabilization change

Title = {Sensitive detection of cancer cells using light-mediated apta-PCR},
Journal = {METHODS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {104-109},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Apta-PCR is an ultrasensitive assay in which aptamers are exploited not
   only as biomolecular recognition elements, but also as reporter labels
   for amplification via real-time PCR. This methodology has been
   successfully applied to the detection of proteins, achieving limits of
   detection in the picomolar range. The introduction of caged aptamers
   that bear photo-labile groups, so called cages, at strategic positions
   so that their tertiary structure and thus their binding properties can
   be controlled by light, facilitates a more robust and attractive assay
   in terms of sample conservation and reusability. In this work, we report
   for the first time the use of caged aptamers for cell detection in an
   apta-PCR assay. Specifically, a sandwich format is used combining the
   capture of B-cells by an antibody with the specific detection of
   Burkitt's lymphoma cancer cells by a caged aptamer, acting as a reporter
   probe. Elution of the aptamer bound to the cancer cells is performed by
   light and the number of cells is then correlated with the amount of
   eluted caged aptamer using real-time PCR analysis. The reported
   technique shows an excellent sensitivity, achieving detection of as few
   as 77 cells, and due to the inherent robustness of the assay, this
   detection platform can be reused for further analyses, demonstrating
   potential applicability in proteomics and clinical diagnostics. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process promoting survival under
   various environmental stress conditions. Selective types of autophagy
   have gained much interest recently as they are involved in specific
   quality control mechanisms removing, for example, aggregated proteins or
   dysfunctional mitochondria. This is considered to counteract the
   development of a number of neurodegenerative disorders and aging. Here
   we review the role of mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics in ensuring
   quality control of mitochondria. In particular, we provide possible
   explanations why mitophagy in yeast, in contrast with the situation in
   mammals, was found to be independent of mitochondrial fission. We
   further discuss recent findings linking these processes to nutrient
   sensing pathways and the general stress response in yeast. In
   particular, we propose a model for how the stress response protein Whi2
   and the Ras/PKA (protein kinase A) signalling pathway are possibly
   linked and thereby regulate mitophagy.},

Abstract = {We report on quantitative single-molecule localization microscopy, a
   method that next to super-resolved images of cellular structures
   provides information on protein copy numbers in protein clusters. This
   approach is based on the analysis of blinking cycles of single
   fluorophores, and on a model-free description of the distribution of the
   number of blinking events. We describe the experimental and analytical
   procedures, present cellular data of plasma membrane proteins and
   discuss the applicability of this method.},

Abstract = {The crystal structure of the c-ring from the proton-coupled F1Fo ATP
   synthase from Spirulina platensis is shown at 2.1-angstrom resolution.
   The ring includes 15 membrane-embedded c subunits forming an
   hourglass-shaped assembly. The structure demonstrates that proton
   translocation across the membrane entails protonation of a conserved
   glutamate located near the membrane center in the c subunit outer helix.
   The proton is locked in this site by a precise hydrogen bond network
   reminiscent of that in Na+-dependent ATP synthases. However, the
   structure suggests that the different coordination chemistry of the
   bound proton and the smaller curvature of the outer helix drastically
   enhance the selectivity of the H+ site against other cations, including
   H3O+. We propose a model for proton translocation whereby the c subunits
   remain in this proton-locked state when facing the membrane lipid.
   Proton exchange would occur in a more hydrophilic and electrostatically
   distinct environment upon contact with the a subunit interface.},

Title = {The Pearling Transition Provides Evidence of Force-Driven Endosomal
   Tubulation during Salmonella Infection},
Journal = {MBIO},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Bacterial pathogens exploit eukaryotic pathways for their own end. Upon
   ingestion, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium passes through the
   stomach and then catalyzes its uptake across the intestinal epithelium.
   It survives and replicates in an acidic vacuole through the action of
   virulence factors secreted by a type three secretion system located on
   Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2). Two secreted effectors, SifA
   and SseJ, are sufficient for endosomal tubule formation, which modifies
   the vacuole and enables Salmonella to replicate within it. Two-color,
   superresolution imaging of the secreted virulence factor SseJ and
   tubulin revealed that SseJ formed clusters of conserved size at regular,
   periodic intervals in the host cytoplasm. Analysis of SseJ clustering
   indicated the presence of a pearling effect, which is a force-driven,
   osmotically sensitive process. The pearling transition is an instability
   driven by membranes under tension; it is induced by hypotonic or
   hypertonic buffer exchange and leads to the formation of beadlike
   structures of similar size and regular spacing. Reducing the osmolality
   of the fixation conditions using glutaraldehyde enabled visualization of
   continuous and intact tubules. Correlation analysis revealed that SseJ
   was colocalized with the motor protein kinesin. Tubulation of the
   endoplasmic reticulum is driven by microtubule motors, and in the
   present work, we describe how Salmonella has coopted the microtubule
   motor kinesin to drive the force-dependent process of endosomal
   tubulation. Thus, endosomal tubule formation is a force-driven process
   catalyzed by Salmonella virulence factors secreted into the host
   cytoplasm during infection.
   IMPORTANCE This study represents the first example of using two-color,
   superresolution imaging to analyze the secretion of Salmonella virulence
   factors as they are secreted from the SPI-2 type three secretion system.
   Previous studies imaged effectors that were overexpressed in the host
   cytoplasm. The present work reveals an unusual force-driven process, the
   pearling transition, which indicates that Salmonella-induced filaments
   are under force through the interactions of effector molecules with the
   motor protein kinesin. This work provides a caution by highlighting how
   fixation conditions can influence the images observed.},

Abstract = {Germ cells are totipotent and, in principle, immortal as they are the
   source for new germ cells in each generation. This very special role
   requires tight quality control systems. The p53 protein family
   constitutes one of the most important quality surveillance systems in
   cells. Whereas p53 has become famous for its role as the guardian of the
   genome in its function as the most important somatic tumor suppressor,
   p63 has been nicknamed `guardian of the female germ line'. p63 is
   strongly expressed in resting oocytes and responsible for eliminating
   those that carry DNA double-strand breaks. The third family member, p73,
   acts later during oocyte and embryo development by ensuring correct
   assembly of the spindle assembly checkpoint. In addition to its role in
   the female germ line, p73 regulates cell-cell contacts between
   developing sperm cells and supporting somatic cells in the male germ
   line. Here, we review the involvement of the p53 protein family in the
   development of germ cells with a focus on quality control in the female
   germ line and discuss medical implications for cancer patients.},

Journal = {ELIFE},

Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic factor that
   play important roles in the nervous system, although it is still unclear
   which receptors transduce those signals in neurons. Here, we show that
   in the developing hippocampus VEGFR2 (also known as KDR or FLK1) is
   expressed specifically in the CA3 region and it is required for
   dendritic arborization and spine morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons.
   Mice lacking VEGFR2 in neurons (Nes-cre Kdr(lox/-)) show decreased
   dendritic arbors and spines as well as a reduction in long-term
   potentiation (LTP) at the associational-commissural - CA3 synapses.
   Mechanistically, VEGFR2 internalization is required for VEGF-induced
   spine maturation. In analogy to endothelial cells, ephrinB2 controls
   VEGFR2 internalization in neurons. VEGFR2-ephrinB2 compound mice
   (Nes-cre Kdr(lox/+) Efnb2(lox/+)) show reduced dendritic branching,
   reduced spine head size and impaired LTP. Our results demonstrate the
   functional crosstalk of VEGFR2 and ephrinB2 in vivo to control dendritic
   arborization, spine morphogenesis and hippocampal circuitry development.},

Abstract = {Mass spectrometry of membrane protein complexes is still a
   methodological challenge due to hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of the
   species and the fact that all subunits are bound non-covalently
   together. The present study with the novel laser induced liquid bead ion
   desorption mass spectrometry (LILBID-MS) reports on the determination of
   the subunit composition of the F1Fo-ATP synthase from Bacillus
   pseudofirmus OF4, that of both bovine heart and, for the first time, of
   human heart mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthases. Under selected buffer
   conditions the mass of the intact F1Fo-ATP synthase of B. pseudofirmus
   OF4 could be measured, allowing the analysis of complex subunit
   stoichiometry. The agreement with theoretical masses derived from
   sequence databases is very good. A comparison of the ATP synthase
   subunit composition of 5 different ATPases reveals differences in the
   complexity of eukaryotic and bacterial ATP synthases. However, whereas
   the overall construction of eukaryotic enzymes is more complex than the
   bacterial ones, functionally important subunits are conserved among all
   ATPases.},

Abstract = {Acyl carrier proteins of mitochondria (ACPMs) are small (similar to 10
   kDa) acidic proteins that are homologous to the corresponding central
   components of prokaryotic fatty acid synthase complexes. Genomic
   deletions of the two genes ACPM1 and ACPM2 in the strictly aerobic yeast
   Yarrowia lipolytica resulted in strains that were not viable or retained
   only trace amounts of assembled mitochondrial complex 1, respectively.
   This suggested different functions for the two proteins that despite
   high similarity could not be complemented by the respective other
   homolog still expressed in the deletion strains. Remarkably, the same
   phenotypes were observed if just the conserved serine carrying the
   phosphopantethein moiety was exchanged with alanine. Although this
   suggested a functional link to the lipid metabolism of mitochondria, no
   changes in the lipid composition of the organelles were found. Proteomic
   analysis revealed that both ACPMs were tightly bound to purified
   mitochondrial complex I. Western blot analysis revealed that the
   affinity tagged ACPM1 and ACPM2 proteins were exclusively detectable in
   mitochondrial membranes but not in the mitochondrial matrix as reported
   for other organisms. Hence we conclude that the ACPMs can serve all
   their possible functions in mitochondrial lipid metabolism and complex I
   assembly and stabilization as subunits bound to complex I. (C) 2009

Abstract = {The aerobic Escherichia coli C4-dicarboxylate transporter DctA and the
   anaerobic fumarate/succinate antiporter DcuB function as obligate
   co-sensors of the fumarate responsive sensor kinase DcuS under aerobic
   or anaerobic conditions respectively. Overproduction under anaerobic
   conditions allowed DctA to replace DcuB in co-sensing, indicating their
   functional equivalence in this capacity. In vivo interaction studies
   between DctA and DcuS using FRET or a bacterial two-hybrid system
   (BACTH) demonstrated their interaction. DctAYFP bound to an affinity
   column and was able to retain DcuS. DctA shows substantial sequence and
   secondary structure conservation to GltPh, the Na+/glutamate symporter
   of Pyrococcus horikoshii with known 3D structure. Topology studies of
   DctA demonstrated the presence of eight transmembrane helices in an
   arrangement similar to that of GltPh. DctA contains an additional
   predicted amphipathic helix 8b on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane
   that is specific for DctA and not present in GltPh. Mutational analysis
   demonstrated the importance of helix 8b in co-sensing and interaction
   with DcuS, and the isolated helix 8b showed strong interaction with
   DcuS. In DcuS, deletion and mutation of the cytoplasmic PASC domain
   affected the interaction between DctA and DcuS. It is concluded that
   DctA forms a functional unit or sensor complex with DcuS through
   specific interaction sites.},

Abstract = {The hydrophobically guided complex formation between the Cu-A fragment
   from Therm us thermophilus ba(3) terminal oxidase and its electron
   transfer substrate, cytochrome c(552), was investigated
   electrochemically. In the presence of the purified CuA fragment, a clear
   downshift of the c(552) redox potential from 171 to 111 mV +/- 10 mV vs
   SHE' was found. Interestingly, this potential change fully matches
   complex formation with this electron acceptor site in other oxidases
   guided by electrostatic or covalent interactions. Redox induced FTIR
   difference spectra revealed conformational changes associated with
   complex formation and indicated the involvement of heme propionates.

Abstract = {ATP synthase membrane rotors consist of a ring of c-subunits whose
   stoichiometry is constant for a given species but variable across
   different ones. We investigated the importance of c/c-subunit contacts
   by site-directed mutagenesis of a conserved stretch of glycines
   (GxGxGxGxG) in a bacterial c(11) ring. Structural and biochemical
   studies show a direct, specific influence on the c-subunit
   stoichiometry, revealing c(<11), c(12), c(13), c(14), and c(>14) rings.
   Molecular dynamics simulations rationalize this effect in terms of the
   energetics and geometry of the c-subunit interfaces. Quantitative data
   from a spectroscopic interaction study demonstrate that the complex
   assembly is independent of the c-ring size. Real-time ATP synthesis
   experiments in proteoliposomes show the mutant enzyme, harboring the
   larger c(12) instead of c(11), is functional at lower ion motive force.
   The high degree of compliance in the architecture of the ATP synthase
   rotor offers a rationale for the natural diversity of c-ring
   stoichiometries, which likely reflect adaptations to specific
   bioenergetic demands. These results provide the basis for bioengineering
   ATP synthases with customized ion-to-ATP ratios, by sequence
   modifications.},

Abstract = {The c-rings of ATP synthases consist of individual c-subunits, all of
   which harbor a conserved motif of repetitive glycine residues (GxGxGxG)
   important for tight transmembrane a-helix packing. The c-ring
   stoichiometry determines the number of ions transferred during enzyme
   operation and has a direct impact on the ion-to-ATP ratio, a cornerstone
   parameter of cell bioenergetics. In the extreme alkaliphile Bacillus
   pseudofirmus OF4, the glycine motif is replaced by AxAxAxA. We performed
   a structural study on two mutants with alanine-to-glycine changes using
   atomic force microscopy and X-ray crystallography, and found that
   mutants form smaller c(12) rings compared with the WT c(13). The molar
   growth yields of B. pseudofirmus OF4 cells on malate further revealed
   that the c(12) mutants have a considerably reduced capacity to grow on
   limiting malate at high pH. Our results demonstrate that the mutant ATP
   synthases with either c(12) or c(13) can support ATP synthesis, and also
   underscore the critical importance of an alanine motif with c(13) ring
   stoichiometry for optimal growth at pH > 10. The data indicate a direct
   connection between the precisely adapted ATP synthase c-ring
   stoichiometry and its ion-to-ATP ratio on cell physiology, and also
   demonstrate the bioenergetic challenges and evolutionary adaptation
   strategies of extremophiles.},

Abstract = {Mitochondria! complex I is an intricate 1 MDa membrane protein complex

   accessory NDUFS4 subunit of human complex I is a hot spot for fatal
   pathogenic mutations in humans. We have deleted the gene for the
   orthologous NUYM subunit in the aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, an
   established model system to study eukaryotic complex I and complex I
   linked diseases. We observed assembly of complex I which lacked only
   subunit NUYM and retained weak interaction with assembly factor N7BML
   (human NDUFAF2). Absence of NUYM caused distortion of iron sulfur
   clusters of the electron input domain leading to decreased complex I
   activity and increased release of reactive oxygen species. We conclude
   that NUYM has an important stabilizing function for the electron input
   module of complex I and is essential for proper complex I function. (C)

Abstract = {Although the Ub-binding domain in ABIN proteins and NEMO (UBAN) is
   highly conserved, UBAN-containing proteins exhibit different Ub-binding
   properties, resulting in their diverse biological roles.
   Post-translational modifications further control UBAN domain specificity
   for poly-Ub chains. However, precisely, how the UBAN domain structurally
   confers such functional diversity remains poorly understood. Here we
   report crystal structures of ABIN-1 alone and in complex with one or two
   M1-linked di-Ub chains. ABIN-1 UBAN forms a homo-dimer that provides two
   symmetrical Ub-binding sites on either side of the coiled-coil
   structure. Moreover, crystal structures of ABIN1 UBAN in complex with
   di-Ub chains reveal a concentration-dependency of UBAN/di-Ub binding
   stoichiometry. Analysis of UBAN/M1-linked di-Ub binding characteristics
   indicates that phosphorylated S473 in OPTN and its corresponding
   phospho-mimetic residue in ABIN-1 (E484) are essential for high affinity
   interactions with M1-linked Ub chains. Also, a phospho-mimetic mutation
   of A303 in NEMO, corresponding to S473 of OPTN, increases binding
   affinity for M1-linked Ub chains. These findings are in line with the
   diverse physiological roles of UBAN domains, as phosphorylation of OPTN
   UBAN is required to enhance its binding to Ub during mitophagy. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Gephyrin is a scaffolding protein important for the postsynaptic
   clustering of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors. Here, we
   investigated the properties of gephyrin scaffolds at gamma-aminobutyric
   acid- (GABA-)ergic synapses in organotypic entorhino-hippocampal
   cultures prepared from a transgenic mouse line, which expresses green
   fluorescent protein-tagged gephyrin under the control of the Thy1.2
   promoter. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed a
   developmental stabilization of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters
   concomitant with an increase in cluster size and synaptic strength
   between 1 and 4 weeks in vitro. Prolonged treatment of the slice
   cultures with diazepam or a GABA(A) receptor antagonist disclosed a
   homeostatic regulation of both inhibitory synaptic strength and gephyrin
   cluster size and stability in 4-weeks-old cultures, whereas at 1 week in
   vitro, the same drug treatments modulated GABAergic postsynapse and
   gephyrin cluster properties following a Hebbian mode of synaptic
   plasticity. Our data are consistent with a model in which the postnatal
   maturation of the hippocampal network endows CA1 pyramidal neurons with
   the ability to homeostatically adjust the strength of their inhibitory
   postsynapses to afferent GABAergic drive by regulating gephyrin scaffold
   properties.},

Title = {Functional Dissection of the Proton Pumping Modules of Mitochondrial
   Complex I},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complicated proton pump of
   the respiratory chain, links the electron transfer from NADH to
   ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the
   intermembrane space. In humans, defects in complex I are involved in a
   wide range of degenerative disorders. Recent progress in the X-ray
   structural analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic complex I confirmed
   that the redox reactions are confined entirely to the hydrophilic
   peripheral arm of the L-shaped molecule and take place at a remarkable
   distance from the membrane domain. While this clearly implies that the
   proton pumping within the membrane arm of complex I is driven indirectly
   via long-range conformational coupling, the molecular mechanism and the
   number, identity, and localization of the pump-sites remains unclear.
   Here, we report that upon deletion of the gene for a small accessory
   subunit of the Yarrowia complex I, a stable subcomplex (nb8m Delta) is
   formed that lacks the distal part of the membrane domain as revealed by
   single particle analysis. The analysis of the subunit composition of
   holo and subcomplex by three complementary proteomic approaches revealed
   that two (ND4 and ND5) of the three subunits with homology to bacterial
   Mrp-type Na+/H+ antiporters that have been discussed as prime candidates
   for harbouring the proton pumps were missing in nb8m Delta.
   Nevertheless, nb8m Delta still pumps protons at half the stoichiometry
   of the complete enzyme. Our results provide evidence that the membrane
   arm of complex I harbours two functionally distinct pump modules that
   are connected in series by the long helical transmission element
   recently identified by X-ray structural analysis.},

Abstract = {In the c-ring rotor of ATP synthases ions are shuttled across the
   membrane during ATP synthesis by a unique rotary mechanism. We
   investigated characteristics of the c-ring from the alkaliphile Bacillus
   pseudofirmusOF4 with respect to evolutionary adaptations to operate with
   protons at high environmental pH. The X-ray structures of the wild-type
   c13 ring at pH 9.0 and a neutralophile-like' mutant (P51A) at pH 4.4, at
   2.4 and 2.8 angstrom resolution, respectively, reveal a dependency of
   the conformation and protonation state of the proton-binding glutamate
   (E54) on environmental hydrophobicity. Faster labelling kinetics with
   the inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) demonstrate a greater
   flexibility of E54 in the mutant due to reduced water occupancy within
   the H+ binding site. A second neutralophile-like' mutant (V21N) shows
   reduced growth at high pH, which is explained by restricted
   conformational freedom of the mutant's E54 carboxylate. The study
   directly connects subtle structural adaptations of the c-ring ion
   binding site to in vivo effects of alkaliphile cell physiology.},

Title = {Distinct roles of the two isoforms of the dynamin-like GTPase Mgm1 in

Abstract = {The mitochondrial dynamin-like GTPase Mgm1 exists as a long (l-Mgm1) and
   a short isoform (s-Mgm1). They both are essential for mitochondrial
   fusion. Here we show that the isoforms interact in a homotypic and
   heterotypic manner. Their submitochondrial distribution between inner
   boundary membrane and cristae was markedly different. Overexpression of
   l-Mgm1 exerts a dominant negative effect on mitochondrial fusion. A
   functional GTPase domain is required only in s-Mgm1 but not in l-Mgm1.
   We propose that l-Mgm1 acts primarily as an anchor in the inner membrane
   that in concert with the GTPase activity of s-Mgm1 mediates the fusion
   of inner membranes. (C) 2009 Federation of European Biochemical

   review the field of single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) by
   providing an overview of its underlying principles and of different
   categories of photoswitchable fluorophores. In addition to summarizing
   target-specific labelling strategies and presenting examples of

Title = {Disruption of the Microglial ADP Receptor P2Y(13) Enhances Adult
   Hippocampal Neurogenesis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {In mammalian species, including humans, the hippocampal dentate gyrus
   (DG) is a primary region of adult neurogenesis. Aberrant adult
   hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with neurological pathologies.
   Understanding the cellular mechanisms controlling adult hippocampal
   neurogenesis is expected to open new therapeutic strategies for mental
   disorders. Microglia is intimately associated with neural progenitor
   cells in the hippocampal DG and has been implicated, under varying
   experimental conditions, in the control of the proliferation,
   differentiation and survival of neural precursor cells. But the
   underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Using fluorescent in situ
   hybridization we show that microglia in brain express the ADP-activated
   P2Y(13) receptor under basal conditions and that P2ry13 mRNA is absent
   from neurons, astrocytes, and neural progenitor cells. Disrupting P2ry13
   decreases structural complexity of microglia in the hippocampal
   subgranular zone (SGZ). But it increases progenitor cell proliferation
   and new neuron formation. Our data suggest that P2Y(13)
   receptor-activated microglia constitutively attenuate hippocampal
   neurogenesis. This identifies a signaling pathway whereby microglia, via
   a nucleotide-mediated mechanism, contribute to the homeostatic control
   of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Selective P2Y(13)R antagonists could
   boost neurogenesis in pathological conditions associated with impaired
   hippocampal neurogenesis.},

Abstract = {We purified the F-o complex from the Ilyobacter tartaricus
   Na+-translocating F1Fo-ATP synthase and performed a biochemical and
   structural study. Laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption MS analysis
   demonstrates that all three subunits of the isolated F-o complex were
   present and in native stoichiometry (ab(2)c(11)). Cryoelectron
   microscopy of 2D crystals yielded a projection map at a resolution of
   7.0 angstrom showing electron densities from the c(11) rotor ring and up
   to seven adjacent helices. A bundle of four helices belongs to the
   stator a-subunit and is in contact with c(11). A fifth helix adjacent to
   the four-helix bundle interacts very closely with a c-subunit helix,
   which slightly shifts its position toward the ring center. Atomic force
   microscopy confirms the presence of the F-o stator, and a height profile
   reveals that it protrudes less from the membrane than c(11). The data
   limit the dimensions of the subunit a/c-ring interface: Three helices
   from the stator region are in contact with three c(11) helices. The
   location and distances of the stator helices impose spatial restrictions
   on the bacterial F-o complex.},

Title = {Emergence of the Mitochondrial Reticulum from Fission and Fusion
   Dynamics},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {Mitochondria form a dynamic tubular reticulum within eukaryotic cells.
   Currently, quantitative understanding of its morphological
   characteristics is largely absent, despite major progress in deciphering
   the molecular fission and fusion machineries shaping its structure. Here
   we address the principles of formation and the large-scale organization
   of the cell-wide network of mitochondria. On the basis of experimentally
   determined structural features we establish the tip-to-tip and
   tip-to-side fission and fusion events as dominant reactions in the
   motility of this organelle. Subsequently, we introduce a graph-based
   model of the chondriome able to encompass its inherent variability in a
   single framework. Using both mean-field deterministic and explicit
   stochastic mathematical methods we establish a relationship between the
   chondriome structural network characteristics and underlying kinetic
   rate parameters. The computational analysis indicates that mitochondrial
   networks exhibit a percolation threshold. Intrinsic morphological
   instability of the mitochondrial reticulum resulting from its vicinity
   to the percolation transition is proposed as a novel mechanism that can
   be utilized by cells for optimizing their functional competence via
   dynamic remodeling of the chondriome. The detailed size distribution of
   the network components predicted by the dynamic graph representation
   introduces a relationship between chondriome characteristics and cell
   function. It forms a basis for understanding the architecture of
   mitochondria as a cell-wide but inhomogeneous organelle. Analysis of the
   reticulum adaptive configuration offers a direct clarification for its
   impact on numerous physiological processes strongly dependent on
   mitochondrial dynamics and organization, such as efficiency of cellular
   metabolism, tissue differentiation and aging.},

Abstract = {Expression of the AF4-MLL fusion protein in murine hematopoietic
   progenitor/stem cells results in the development of proB acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, we affinity purified the AF4-MLL
   and AF4 protein complexes to elucidate their function. We observed that
   the AF4 complex consists of 11 binding partners and exhibits positive
   transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)-mediated activation of
   promoter-arrested RNA polymerase (pol) II in conjunction with several
   chromatin-modifying activities. In contrast, the AF4-MLL complex
   consists of at least 16 constituents including P-TEFb kinase, H3K4(me3)
   and H3K79(me3) histone methyltransferases (HMT), a protein arginine
   N-methyltransferase and a histone acetyltransferase. These findings
   suggest that the AF4-MLL protein disturbs the fine-tuned activation
   cycle of promoter-arrested RNA Pol II and causes altered histone
   methylation signatures. Thus, we propose that these two processes are
   key to trigger cellular reprogramming that leads to the onset of acute
   leukemia. Leukemia (2011) 25, 135-144; doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.249;

Abstract = {The respiratory cytochrome bc(1), complex is a fundamental enzyme in
   biological energy conversion. It couples electron transfer from
   ubiquinol to cytochrome c with generation of proton motive force which
   fuels ATP synthesis. The complex from the alpha-proteobacterium
   Paracoccus denitrificans, a model for the medically relevant
   mitochondrial complexes, lacked structural characterization. We show by
   LILBID mass spectrometry that truncation of the organism-specific,
   acidic N-terminus of cytochrome c(1) changes the oligomerization state
   of the enzyme to a dimer. The fully functional complex was crystallized
   and the X-ray structure determined at 2.7-angstrom resolution. It has
   high structural homology to mitochondrial complexes and to the
   Rhodobacter sphaeroides complex especially for subunits cytochrome b and
   ISP. Species-specific binding of the inhibitor stigmatellin is
   noteworthy. Interestingly, cytochrome c(1) shows structural differences
   to the mitochondrial and even between the two Rhodobacteraceae
   complexes. The structural diversity in the cytochrome c(1) surface
   facing the ISP domain indicates low structural constraints on that
   surface for formation of a productive electron transfer complex. A
   similar position of the acidic N-terminal domains of cytochrome c(1) and
   yeast subunit QCR6p is suggested in support of a similar function. A
   model of the electron transfer complex with membrane-anchored cytochrome
   C-552, the natural substrate, shows that it can adopt the same
   orientation as the soluble substrate in the yeast complex. The full
   structural integrity of the P. denitrificans variant underpins previous
   mechanistic studies on intermonomer electron transfer and paves the way
   for using this model system to address open questions of
   structure/function relationships and inhibitor binding. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Cortical flows mediate anteroposterior polarization in Caenorhabditis
   elegans by generating two mutually exclusive membrane domains. However,
   factors downstream of anteroposterior polarity that establish the
   dorsoventral axis remain elusive. Here, we show that rotational cortical
   flow orthogonal to the anteroposterior axis during the division of the
   AB blastomere in the two-cell embryo positions the cytokinetic midbody
   remnant of the previous division asymmetrically at the future ventral
   side of the embryo. In the neighboring P1 blastomere, astral
   microtubules contact a transient PAR-2-dependent actin coat that forms
   asymmetrically onto the midbody remnant-P1 interface. Ablation of the
   midbody remnant or perturbation of rotational cortical flow reveals that
   microtubule-midbody remnant contacts are crucial for P1 spindle rotation
   and dorsoventral axis formation. Thus, our findings suggest a mechanism
   for dorsoventral patterning that relies on coupling of anteroposterior
   polarity, rotational cortical flow, midbody remnant positioning, and
   spindle orientation.},

Abstract = {To correctly transfer information, neuronal networks need to
   continuously adjust their synaptic strength to extrinsic stimuli. This
   ability, termed synaptic plasticity, is at the heart of their function
   and is, thus, tightly regulated. In glutamatergic neurons, synaptic
   strength is controlled by the number and function of AMPA receptors at
   the postsynapse, which mediate most of the fast excitatory transmission
   in the central nervous system. Their trafficking to, at, and from the
   synapse, is, therefore, a key mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity.
   Intensive research over the last 20years has revealed the increasing
   importance of interacting proteins, which accompany AMPA receptors
   throughout their lifetime and help to refine the temporal and spatial
   modulation of their trafficking and function. In this review, we discuss
   the current knowledge about the roles of key partners in regulating AMPA
   receptor trafficking and focus especially on the movement between the
   intracellular, extrasynaptic, and synaptic pools. We examine their
   involvement not only in basal synaptic function, but also in Hebbian and
   homeostatic plasticity. Included in our review are well-established AMPA
   receptor interactants such as GRIP1 and PICK1, the classical auxiliary
   subunits TARP and CNIH, and the newest additions to AMPA receptor native
   complexes.},

Abstract = {The architecture of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is controlled by the
   communication of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. We found that the
   neuronal guidance cue reelin possesses proangiogenic activities that
   ensure the communication of endothelial cells (ECs) with the glia to
   control neuronal migration and the establishment of the blood-brain
   barrier in the mouse brain. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and
   Disabled1 (Dab1) expressed in ECs are required for vascularization of
   the retina and the cerebral cortex. Deletion of Dab1 in ECs leads to a
   reduced secretion of laminin-alpha 4 and decreased activation of
   integrin-beta 1 in glial cells, which in turn control neuronal migration
   and barrier properties of the NVU. Thus, reelin signaling in the
   endothelium is an instructive and integrative cue essential for
   neuro-glia-vascular communication.},

   super-resolution microscopy. We determined arrestin 3 cluster sizes and
   relative fractions of arrestin 3 molecules in each cluster through
   image-based analysis of the localization data by adapting a method
   originally developed for co-localization analysis from molecular
   coordinates. We found that only classical agonists in the set of tested
   ligands were able to efficiently recruit arrestin 3 to clusters mostly
   larger than 150 nm in size and compare our results with existing data on
   arrestin 2 clustering induced by the same chemokine analogues.},

Abstract = {Mitophagy is crucial to ensuring mitochondrial quality control. However,
   the molecular mechanism and regulation of mitophagy are still not fully
   understood. Here, we developed a quantitative methodology termed
   synthetic quantitative array (SQA) technology, which allowed us to
   perform a genome-wide screen for modulators of rapamycin-induced
   mitophagy in S. cerevisiae. SQA technology can be easily employed for
   other enzyme-based reporter systems and widely applied in yeast
   research. We identified 86 positive and 10 negative regulators of
   mitophagy. Moreover, SQA-based analysis of non-selective autophagy
   revealed that 63 of these regulators are specific for mitophagy and 33
   regulate autophagy in general. The Ubp3-Bre5 deubiquitination complex
   was found to inhibit mitophagy but, conversely, to promote other types
   of autophagy, including ribophagy. This complex translocates dynamically
   to mitochondria upon induction of mitophagy. These findings point to a
   role of ubiquitination in mitophagy in yeast and suggest a reciprocal
   regulation of distinct autophagy pathways.},

Title = {Structural basis for the recognition and degradation of host TRIM
   proteins by Salmonella effector SopA},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {The hallmark of Salmonella Typhimurium infection is an acute intestinal
   inflammatory response, which is mediated through the action of secreted
   bacterial effector proteins. The pro-inflammatory Salmonella effector
   SopA is a HECT-like E3 ligase, which was previously proposed to activate
   host RING ligases TRIM56 and TRIM65. Here we elucidate an inhibitory
   mechanism of TRIM56 and TRIM65 targeting by SopA. We present the crystal
   structure of SopA in complex with the RING domain of human TRIM56,
   revealing the atomic details of their interaction and the basis for SopA
   selectivity towards TRIM56 and TRIM65. Structure-guided biochemical
   analysis shows that SopA inhibits TRIM56 E3 ligase activity by occluding
   the E2-interacting surface of TRIM56. We further demonstrate that SopA
   ubiquitinates TRIM56 and TRIM65, resulting in their proteasomal
   degradation during infection. Our results provide the basis for how a
   bacterial HECT ligase blocks host RING ligases and exemplifies the
   multivalent power of bacterial effectors during infection.},

Abstract = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to apoptosis, aging, cancer, and a
   number of neurodegenerative and muscular disorders. The interplay
   between mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to the
   removal of dysfunctional mitochondria ensuring mitochondrial quality
   control. An open question is what role mitochondrial fission plays in
   the removal of mitochondria after mild and transient oxidative stress;
   conditions reported to result in moderately elevated reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) levels comparable to physical activity. Here we show that
   applying such conditions led to fragmentation of mitochondria and
   induction of mitophagy in mouse and human cells. These conditions
   increased ROS levels only slightly and neither triggered cell death nor
   led to a detectable induction of non-selective autophagy. Starvation led
   to hyperfusion of mitochondria, to high ROS levels, and to the induction
   of both non-selective autophagy and to a lesser extent to mitophagy. We
   conclude that moderate levels of ROS specifically trigger mitophagy but
   are insufficient to trigger non-selective autophagy. Expression of a
   dominant-negative variant of the fission factor DRP1 blocked mitophagy
   induction by mild oxidative stress as well as by starvation. Taken
   together, we demonstrate that in mammalian cells under mild oxidative
   stress a DRP1-dependent type of mitophagy is triggered while a
   concomitant induction of non-selective autophagy was not observed. We
   propose that these mild oxidative conditions resembling well
   physiological situations are thus very helpful for studying the
   molecular pathways governing the selective removal of dysfunctional
   mitochondria. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Deceleration of Fusion-Fission Cycles Improves Mitochondrial Quality
   Control during Aging},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy play a key role in ensuring
   mitochondrial quality control. Impairment thereof was proposed to be
   causative to neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and cancer.
   Accumulation of mitochondrial dysfunction was further linked to aging.
   Here we applied a probabilistic modeling approach integrating our
   current knowledge on mitochondrial biology allowing us to simulate
   mitochondrial function and quality control during aging in silico. We
   demonstrate that cycles of fusion and fission and mitophagy indeed are
   essential for ensuring a high average quality of mitochondria, even
   under conditions in which random molecular damage is present. Prompted
   by earlier observations that mitochondrial fission itself can cause a
   partial drop in mitochondrial membrane potential, we tested the
   consequences of mitochondrial dynamics being harmful on its own. Next to
   directly impairing mitochondrial function, pre-existing molecular damage
   may be propagated and enhanced across the mitochondrial population by
   content mixing. In this situation, such an infection-like phenomenon
   impairs mitochondrial quality control progressively. However, when
   imposing an age-dependent deceleration of cycles of fusion and fission,
   we observe a delay in the loss of average quality of mitochondria. This
   provides a rational why fusion and fission rates are reduced during
   aging and why loss of a mitochondrial fission factor can extend life
   span in fungi. We propose the `mitochondrial infectious damage
   adaptation' (MIDA) model according to which a deceleration of
   fusion-fission cycles reflects a systemic adaptation increasing life
   span.},

Abstract = {Photoregulation of RNA remains a challenging task as the introduction of
   a photoswitch entails changes in the shape and the stability of the
   duplex that strongly depend on the chosen linker strategy. Herein, the
   influence of a novel nucleosidic linker moiety on the photoregulation
   efficiency of azobenzene is investigated. To this purpose, two
   azobenzene C-nucleosides were stereoselectively synthesized,
   characterized, and incorporated into RNA oligonucleotides. Spectroscopic
   characterization revealed a reversible and fast switching process, even
   at 20 degrees C, and a high thermal stability of the respective cis
   isomers. The photoregulation efficiency of RNA duplexes upon
   trans-to-cis isomerization was investigated by using melting point
   studies and compared with the known D-threoninol-based azobenzene
   system, revealing a photoswitching amplitude of the new residues
   exceeding 90\% even at room temperature. Structural changes in the
   duplexes upon photoisomerization were investigated by using MM/MD
   calculations. The excellent photoswitching performance at room
   temperature and the high thermal stability make these new azobenzene
   residues promising candidates for in-vivo and nanoarchitecture
   photoregulation applications of RNA.},

Abstract = {Glomerular mesangial cells are smooth muscle cell-like pericytes and are
   regarded as key players in kidney diseases. In an inflammatory setting,
   these cells produce high amounts of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines
   and redox mediators such as reactive oxygen species or nitric oxide
   (NO). The temporal production of ROS, NO and other redox mediators
   markedly contributes to the final outcome of inflammatory diseases.
   Recently, we reported that platelet-derived growth factor forced
   mesangial cells to activate the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A
   (PKA RI) by a redox-dependent mechanism but independent from changes in
   cyclic AMP. This prompted us to further analyze the dimerization of PKA
   RI and activation of PICA-driven signalling in an inflammatory context.
   Stimulation of rat mesangial cells with interleukin-1 beta and tumour
   necrosis factor-alpha {[}2 nM] induced the formation of PKA RI
   heterodimers in a time-dependent manner. PKA RI dimerization was
   accompanied with the formation of ROS, NO and peroxynitrite as well as a
   depletion of reduced glutathione. Furthermore, dimerization of PKA RI
   was paralleled by enhanced activity of PKA as shown by the
   phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) at
   serine 157 that was independent of the formation of cyclic AMP.
   Remarkably, exogenously administered peroxynitrite potently induced
   dimerization of PKA RI, whereas pharmacologic inhibition of inducible NO
   synthase (iNOS) and scavenging of peroxynitrite reduced PKA RI
   dimerization and VASP phosphorylation to control levels thus clearly
   indicating a causal role for endogenously formed peroxynitrite on PKA
   signalling. Consequently, the treatment of inflammatory diseases with
   anti-oxidants or NOS inhibitors may alter PKA activity. (C) 2014

Title = {QuickPIV: Efficient 3D particle image velocimetry software applied to
   quantifying cellular migration during embryogenesis},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Background The technical development of imaging techniques in life
   sciences has enabled the three-dimensional recording of living samples
   at increasing temporal resolutions. Dynamic 3D data sets of developing
   organisms allow for time-resolved quantitative analyses of morphogenetic
   changes in three dimensions, but require efficient and automatable
   analysis pipelines to tackle the resulting Terabytes of image data.
   Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a robust and segmentation-free
   technique that is suitable for quantifying collective cellular migration
   on data sets with different labeling schemes. This paper presents the
   implementation of an efficient 3D PIV package using the Julia
   programming language-quickPIV. Our software is focused on optimizing CPU
   performance and ensuring the robustness of the PIV analyses on
   biological data. Results QuickPIV is three times faster than the Python
   implementation hosted in openPIV, both in 2D and 3D. Our software is
   also faster than the fastest 2D PIV package in openPIV, written in C++.
   The accuracy evaluation of our software on synthetic data agrees with
   the expected accuracies described in the literature. Additionally, by
   applying quickPIV to three data sets of the embryogenesis of Tribolium
   castaneum, we obtained vector fields that recapitulate the migration
   movements of gastrulation, both in nuclear and actin-labeled embryos. We
   show normalized squared error cross-correlation to be especially
   accurate in detecting translations in non-segmentable biological image
   data. Conclusions The presented software addresses the need for a fast
   and open-source 3D PIV package in biological research. Currently,
   quickPIV offers efficient 2D and 3D PIV analyses featuring
   zero-normalized and normalized squared error cross-correlations,
   sub-pixel/voxel approximation, and multi-pass. Post-processing options
   include filtering and averaging of the resulting vector fields,
   extraction of velocity, divergence and collectiveness maps, simulation
   of pseudo-trajectories, and unit conversion. In addition, our software
   includes functions to visualize the 3D vector fields in Paraview.},

Title = {APP Is a Context-Sensitive Regulator of the Hippocampal Presynaptic
   Active Zone},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {The hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by cognitive
   decline and behavioral changes. The most prominent brain region affected
   by the progression of AD is the hippocampal formation. The pathogenesis
   involves a successive loss of hippocampal neurons accompanied by a
   decline in learning and memory consolidation mainly attributed to an
   accumulation of senile plaques. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has
   been identified as precursor of A beta-peptides, the main constituents
   of senile plaques. Until now, little is known about the physiological
   function of APP within the central nervous system. The allocation of APP
   to the proteome of the highly dynamic presynaptic active zone (PAZ)
   highlights APP as a yet unknown player in neuronal communication and
   signaling. In this study, we analyze the impact of APP deletion on the
   hippocampal PAZ proteome. The native hippocampal PAZ derived from APP
   mouse mutants (APP-KOs and NexCreAPP/APLP2-cDKOs) was isolated by
   subcellular fractionation and immunopurification. Subsequently, an
   isobaric labeling was performed using TMT6 for protein identification
   and quantification by high-resolution mass spectrometry. We combine
   bioinformatics tools and biochemical approaches to address the
   proteomics dataset and to understand the role of individual proteins.
   The impact of APP deletion on the hippocampal PAZ proteome was
   visualized by creating protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks that
   incorporated APP into the synaptic vesicle cycle, cytoskeletal
   organization, and calcium-homeostasis. The combination of subcellular
   fractionation, immunopurification, proteomic analysis, and
   bioinformatics allowed us to identify APP as structural and functional
   regulator in a context-sensitive manner within the hippocampal active
   zone network.},

Abstract = {Macromolecular complexes are essential players in numerous biological
   processes. They are often large, dynamic, and rather labile; approaches
   to study them are scarce. Covering masses up to similar to 30 MDa, we
   separated the native complexome of rat heart mitochondria by blue-native
   and large-pore blue-native gel electrophoresis to analyze its
   constituents by mass spectrometry. Similarities in migration patterns
   allowed hierarchical clustering into interaction profiles representing a
   comprehensive analysis of soluble and membrane-bound complexes of an
   entire organelle. The power of this bottom-up approach was validated
   with well-characterized mitochondrial multiprotein complexes. TMEM126B
   was found to comigrate with known assembly factors of mitochondrial
   complex I, namely CIA30, Ecsit, and Acad9. We propose terming this
   complex mitochondria! complex I assembly (MCIA) complex. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that TMEM126B is required for assembly of complex I. In
   summary, complexome profiling is a powerful and unbiased technique
   allowing the identification of previously overlooked components of large
   multiprotein complexes.},

Abstract = {Clustering of arrestins upon G protein-coupled receptor stimulation is a
   phenomenon that is well-known but difficult to describe quantitatively
   due to the size of the clusters close to the diffraction limit of
   visible light. We introduce a general method to quantitatively
   investigate the clustering of arrestin following stimulation of the C-C
   chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) using single-molecule super-resolution
   imaging and coordinate and image-based cluster analysis. We investigated
   the effect of potent anti-HIV ligands of CCR5 with different
   pharmacological profiles on arrestin2 cluster formation and found that
   only the ligands capable of inducing CCR5 internalization induced
   arrestin2 recruitment and clustering. We further demonstrate that the
   fraction of arrestin2 molecules found in clusters larger than 100 nm
   correlates with the magnitude of ligand-induced CCR5 internalization,
   but not with G protein activation, indicating that recruitment of
   arrestin2 to CCR5 is independent of G protein activation. Pre-treatment
   of the cells with the drug cytochalasin D, which blocks actin
   polymerization, led to the formation of larger clusters, whereas the
   inhibitor of microtubule polymerization nocodazole had little effect on
   arrestin2 recruitment, suggesting an active role of actin in the
   organization and dynamics of these aggregates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Type I interferons (IFNs) signal for their diverse biological effects by
   binding a common receptor on target cells, composed of the two
   transmembrane IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 proteins. We have previously
   differentially enhanced the antiproliferative activity of IFN by
   increasing the weak binding affinity of IFN to IFNAR1. In this study, we
   further explored the affinity interdependencies between the two receptor
   subunits and the role of IFNAR1 in differential IFN activity. For this
   purpose, we generated a panel of mutations targeting the IFNAR2 binding
   site on the background of the IFN alpha 2 YNS mutant, which increases
   the affinity to IFNAR1 by 60-fold, resulting in IFNAR2-to-IFNAR1 binding
   affinity ratios ranging from 1000:1 to 1:1000. Both the
   antiproliferative and antiviral potencies of the interferon mutants
   clearly correlated to the in situ binding IC50 values, independently of
   the relative contributions of the individual receptors, thus relating to
   the integral lifetime of the complex. However, the antiproliferative
   potency correlated throughout the entire range of affinities, as well as
   with prolonged IFNAR1 receptor down-regulation, whereas the antiviral
   potency reached a maximum at binding affinities equivalent to that of
   wild-type IFN alpha 2. Our data suggest that (i) the specific activity
   of interferon is related to the ternary complex binding affinity and not
   to affinity toward individual receptor components and (ii) although the
   antiviral pathway is strongly dependent on pSTAT1 activity, the
   cytostatic effect requires additional mechanisms that may involve IFNAR1
   down-regulation. This differential interferon response is ultimately
   mediated through distinct gene expression profiling.},

   promising components for the construction of molecular machines and

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {Imaging non-adherent cells by super-resolution far-field fluorescence
   microscopy is currently not possible because of their rapid movement
   while in suspension. Holographic optical tweezers (HOTs) enable the
   ability to freely control the number and position of optical traps, thus
   facilitating the unrestricted manipulation of cells in a volume around
   the focal plane. Here we show that immobilizing non-adherent cells by
   optical tweezers is sufficient to achieve optical resolution well below
   the diffraction limit using localization microscopy. Individual cells
   can be oriented arbitrarily but preferably either horizontally or
   vertically relative to the microscope's image plane, enabling access to
   sample sections that are impossible to achieve with conventional sample
   preparation and immobilization. This opens up new opportunities to
   super-resolve the nanoscale organization of chromosomal DNA in
   individual bacterial cells.},

Title = {Unraveling the Activation Mechanism of Taspase1 which Controls the
   Oncogenic AF4-MLL Fusion Protein},
Journal = {EBIOMEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Number = {5},
Pages = {386-395},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We have recently demonstrated that Taspase1-mediated cleavage of the
   AF4-MLL oncoprotein results in the formation of a stable multiprotein
   complex which forms the key event for the onset of acute proB leukemia
   in mice. Therefore, Taspase1 represents a conditional oncoprotein in the
   context of t(4; 11) leukemia. In this report, we used site-directed
   mutagenesis to unravel the molecular events by which Taspase1 becomes
   sequentially activated. Monomeric pro-enzymes form dimers which are
   autocatalytically processed into the enzymatically active form of
   Taspase1 (alpha beta beta alpha). The active enzyme cleaves only very
   few target proteins, e.g., MLL, MLL4 and TFIIA at their corresponding
   consensus cleavage sites (CSTasp1) as well as AF4-MLL in the case of
   leukemogenic translocation. This knowledge was translated into the
   design of a dominant-negative mutant of Taspase1 (dnTASP1). As expected,
   simultaneous expression of the leukemogenic AF4-MLL and dnTASP1 causes
   the disappearance of the leukemogenic oncoprotein, because the uncleaved
   AF4-MLL protein (328 kDa) is subject to proteasomal degradation, while
   the cleaved AF4-MLL forms a stable oncogenic multi-protein complex with
   a very long half-life. Moreover, coexpression of dnTASP1with a
   BFP-CSTasp1-GFP FRET biosensor effectively inhibits cleavage. The impact
   of our findings on future drug development and potential treatment
   options for t(4; 11) leukemia will be discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {Proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the largest
   and most complicated enzyme of the respiratory chain. Fourteen central
   subunits represent the minimal form of complex I and can be assigned to
   functional modules for NADH oxidation, ubiquinone reduction, and proton
   pumping. In addition, the mitochondrial enzyme comprises some 30
   accessory subunits surrounding the central subunits that are not
   directly associated with energy conservation. Complex I is known to
   release deleterious oxygen radicals (ROS) and its dysfunction has been
   linked to a number of hereditary and degenerative diseases. We here
   review recent progress in structure determination, and in understanding
   the role of accessory subunits and functional analysis of mitochondrial
   complex I. For the central subunits, structures provide insight into the
   arrangement of functional modules including the substrate binding sites,
   redox-centers and putative proton channels and pump sites. Only for two
   of the accessory subunits, detailed structures are available.
   Nevertheless, many of them could be localized in the overall structure
   of complex I, but most of these assignments have to be considered
   tentative. Strikingly, redox reactions and proton pumping machinery are
   spatially completely separated and the site of reduction for the
   hydrophobic substrate ubiquinone is found deeply buried in the
   hydrophilic domain of the complex. The X-ray structure of complex I from
   Yarrowia lipolytica provides clues supporting the previously proposed
   two-state stabilization change mechanism, in which ubiquinone redox
   chemistry induces conformational states and thereby drives proton
   pumping. The same structural rearrangements may explain the
   active/deactive transition of complex I implying an integrated
   mechanistic model for energy conversion and regulation. This article is
   part of a Special Issue entitled Respiratory complex I, edited by Volker
   Zickermann and Ulrich Brandt. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We determined the structure of a complete, dimeric F1Fo-ATP synthase
   from yeast Yarrowia lipolytica mitochondria by a combination of cryo-EM
   and X-ray crystallography. The final structure resolves 58 of the 60
   dimer subunits. Horizontal helices of subunit a in F-o wrap around the
   c-ring rotor, and a total of six vertical helices assigned to subunits
   a, b, f, i, and 8 span the membrane. Subunit 8 (A6L in human) is an
   evolutionary derivative of the bacterial b subunit. On the lumenal
   membrane surface, subunit f establishes direct contact between the two
   monomers. Comparison with a cryo-EM map of the F1Fo monomer identifies
   subunits e and g at the lateral dimer interface. They do not form dimer
   contacts but enable dimer formation by inducing a strong membrane
   curvature of similar to 100 degrees. Our structure explains the
   structural basis of cristae formation in mitochondria, a landmark
   signature of eukaryotic cell morphology.},

Abstract = {Herein, we report the reversible light-regulated destabilization of DNA
   duplexes by using azobenzene C-nucleoside photoswitches. The
   incorporation of two different azobenzene residues into DNA and their
   photoswitching properties are described. These new residues demonstrate
   a photoinduced destabilization effect comparable to the widely applied
   D-threoninol-linked azobenzene switch, which is currently the benchmark.
   The photoswitches presented herein show excellent photoswitching
   efficiencies in DNA duplexes - even at room temperature - which are
   superior to commonly used azobenzene-based nucleic acid photoswitches.
   In addition, these photoswitching residues exhibit high thermal
   stability and excellent fatigue resistance, thus rendering them one of
   the most efficient candidates for the regulation of duplex stability
   with light.},

Title = {Functional characterisation of different MLL fusion proteins by using

Journal = {CANCER LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {352},
Number = {2},
Pages = {196-202},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Our focus is the identification, characterisation and functional
   analysis of different MLL fusions. In general, MLL fusion proteins are
   encoded by large cDNA cassettes that are difficult to transduce into
   haematopoietic stem cells. This is due to the size limitations of the
   packaging process of those vector-encoded RNAs into retro- or lentiviral
   particles. Here, we present our efforts in establishing a universal
   vector system to analyse different MLL fusions. The universal cloning
   system was embedded into the backbone of the Sleeping Beauty
   transposable element. This transposon has no size limitation and
   displays no integration preference, thereby avoiding the integration
   into active genes or their promoter regions. We utilised this novel
   system to test different MLL fusion alleles (MLL-NEBL, NEBL-MLL,
   MLL-LASP1, LASP1-MLL, MLL-MAML2, MAML2-MLL, MLL-SMAP1 and SMAP1-MLL) in
   appropriate cell lines. Stable cell lines were analysed for their growth
   behaviour, focus formation and colony formation capacity and ectopic
   Hoxa gene transcription. Our results show that only 1/4 tested direct
   MLL fusions, but 3/4 tested reciprocal MLL fusions exhibit oncogenic
   functions. From these pilot experiments, we conclude that a systematic
   analysis of more MLL fusions will result in a more differentiated
   picture about the oncogenic capacity of distinct MLL fusions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Collybistin (Cb), a brain-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor,
   has been shown to be essential for the gephyrin-dependent clustering of
   a specific set of GABA(A) receptors at inhibitory postsynaptic sites.
   Here, we examined whether the lack of Cb affects synaptic properties and
   neuronal activity in the intact hippocampus by monitoring network
   activity in the dentate gyrus of Cb-deficient mice after perforant-path
   stimulation in vivo. We found a decreased threshold for evoked
   population spikes of granule cells, indicating their increased
   excitability. Paired-pulse inhibition of the population spike, a measure
   for somatic GABAergic network inhibition, was enhanced. Mutant mice
   exhibited steeper slopes of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials,
   consistent with a reduced dendritic inhibition, In addition, the
   induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) was reduced. In line with
   these functional changes, the number of postsynaptic gephyrin and
   GABA(A) receptor clusters in the Cb-deficient dentate gyrus was
   significantly decreased. In conclusion, our data provide the first
   evidence that Cb-deficiency leads to significant changes of GABAergic
   inhibition, network excitability and synaptic plasticity in vivo. (C)

Abstract = {Tauopathies like the ``frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked
   to chromosome 17{''} (FTDP-17) are characterized by an aberrant
   accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of
   hyperphosphorylated tau. For FTDP-17, a pathogenic tau mutation P301L
   was identified. Impaired mitochondrial function including disturbed
   dynamics such as fission and fusion are most likely major
   pathomechanisms of most neurodegenerative diseases. However, very little
   is known if tau itself affects mitochondrial function and dynamics. We
   addressed this question using SY5Y cells stably overexpressing wild-type
   (wt) and P301L mutant tau. P301L overexpression resulted in a
   substantial complex I deficit accompanied by decreased ATP levels and
   increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. This was paralleled by
   pronounced changes in mitochondrial morphology, decreased fusion and
   fission rates accompanied by reduced expression of several fission and
   fusion factors like OPA-1 or DRP-1. In contrast, overexpression of wt
   tau exhibits protective effects on mitochondrial function and dynamics
   including enhanced complex I activity. Our findings clearly link tau
   bidirectional to mitochondrial function and dynamics, identifying a
   novel aspect of the physiological role of tau and the pathomechanism of
   tauopathies.},

Abstract = {Epigenetic chemical probes are potent, cell-active, small molecule
   inhibitors or antagonists of specific domains in a protein; they have
   been indispensable for studying bromodomains and protein
   methyltransferases. The Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), comprising
   scientists from academic and pharmaceutical laboratories, has generated
   most of the current epigenetic chemical probes. Moreover, the SGC has
   shared about 4 thousand aliquots of these probes, which have been used
   primarily for phenotypic profiling or to validate targets in cell lines
   or primary patient samples cultured in vitro. Epigenetic chemical probes
   have been critical tools in oncology research and have uncovered
   mechanistic insights into well-established targets, as well as identify
   new therapeutic starting points. Indeed, the literature primarily links
   epigenetic proteins to oncology, but applications in inflammation,
   viral, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases are now being reported.
   We summarize the literature of these emerging applications and provide
   examples where existing probes might be used.},

Abstract = {ABC transporters form one of the largest protein superfamilies in all
   domains of life, catalyzing the movement of diverse substrates across
   membranes. In this key position, ABC transporters canmediate multidrug
   resistance in cancer therapy and their dysfunction is linked to various
   diseases. Here, we describe the 2.7-angstrom X-ray structure of
   heterodimeric Thermus thermophilus multidrug resistance proteins A and B
   (TmrAB), which not only shares structural homology with the antigen
   translocation complex TAP, but is also able to restore antigen
   processing in human TAP-deficient cells. TmrAB exhibits a broad peptide
   specificity and can concentrate substrates several thousandfold, using
   only one single active ATP-binding site. In our structure, TmrAB adopts
   an asymmetric inward-facing state, and we show that the C-terminal
   helices, arranged in a zipper-like fashion, play a crucial role in
   guiding the conformational changes associated with substrate transport.
   In conclusion, TmrAB can be regarded as a model system for asymmetric
   ABC exporters in general, and for TAP in particular.},

Abstract = {Plasticity in the brain is essential for maintaining memory and learning
   and is associated with the dynamic membrane trafficking of AMPA
   receptors. EphrinB proteins, ligands for EphB receptor tyrosine kinases,
   are transmembrane molecules with signaling capabilities that are
   required for spine morphogenesis, synapse formation and synaptic
   plasticity. Here, we describe a molecular mechanism for ephrinB2
   function in controlling synaptic transmission. EphrinB2 signaling is
   critical for the stabilization of AMPA receptors at the cellular
   membrane. Mouse hippocampal neurons from conditional ephrinB2 knockouts
   showed enhanced constitutive internalization of AMPA receptors and
   reduced synaptic transmission. Mechanistically, glutamate receptor
   interacting proteins bridge ephrinB ligands and AMPA receptors.
   Moreover, this function involved a regulatory aspect of ephrinB reverse
   signaling that involves the phosphorylation of a single serine residue
   in their cytoplasmic tails. In summary, our findings uncover a model of
   cooperative AMPA receptor and ephrinB reverse signaling at the synapse.},

Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The turnover of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ensures the correct
   biological activity of its distinct domains. In mammalian cells, the ER
   is degraded via a selective autophagy pathway (ER-phagy), mediated by
   two specific receptors: FAM134B, responsible for the turnover of ER
   sheets and SEC62 that regulates ER recovery following stress. Here, we
   identified reticulon 3 (RTN3) as a specific receptor for the degradation
   of ER tubules. Oligomerization of the long isoform of RTN3 is sufficient
   to trigger fragmentation of ER tubules. The long N-terminal region of
   RTN3 contains several newly identified LC3-interacting regions (LIR).
   Binding to LC3s/GABARAPs is essential for the fragmentation of ER
   tubules and their delivery to lysosomes. RTN3-mediated ER-phagy requires
   conventional autophagy components, but is independent of FAM134B. None
   of the other reticulon family members have the ability to induce
   fragmentation of ER tubules during starvation. Therefore, we assign a
   unique function to RTN3 during autophagy.},

Abstract = {Although both tetracycline and tigecycline inhibit protein synthesis by
   sterically hindering the binding of tRNA to the ribosomal A site,
   tigecycline shows increased efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo
   activity assays and escapes the most common resistance mechanisms
   associated with the tetracycline class of antibiotics. These differences
   in activities are attributed to the tert-butylglycylamido side chain
   found in tigecycline. Our structural analysis by X-ray crystallography
   shows that tigecycline binds the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit with
   its tail in an extended conformation and makes extensive interactions
   with the 16S rRNA nucleotide C1054. These interactions restrict the
   mobility of C1054 and contribute to the antimicrobial activity of
   tigecycline, including its resistance to the ribosomal protection
   proteins.},

Title = {Atomic-Level Structure Characterization of an Ultrafast Folding
   Mini-Protein Denatured State},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Atomic-level analyses of non-native protein ensembles constitute an
   important aspect of protein folding studies to reach a more complete
   understanding of how proteins attain their native form exhibiting
   biological activity. Previously, formation of hydrophobic clusters in
   the 6 M urea-denatured state of an ultrafast folding mini-protein known
   as TC5b from both photo-CIDNP NOE transfer studies and FCS measurements
   was observed. Here, we elucidate the structural properties of this
   mini-protein denatured in 6 M urea performing N-15 NMR relaxation
   studies together with a thorough NOE analysis. Even though our results
   demonstrate that no elements of secondary structure persist in the
   denatured state, the heterogeneous distribution of R-2 rate constants
   together with observing pronounced heteronuclear NOEs along the peptide
   backbone reveals specific regions of urea-denatured TC5b exhibiting a
   high degree of structural rigidity more frequently observed for native
   proteins. The data are complemented with studies on two TC5b point
   mutants to verify the importance of hydrophobic interactions for fast
   folding. Our results corroborate earlier findings of a hydrophobic
   cluster present in urea-denatured TC5b comprising both native and
   non-native contacts underscoring their importance for ultra rapid
   folding. The data assist in finding ways of interpreting the effects of
   pre-existing native and/or non-native interactions on the ultrafast
   folding of proteins; a fact, which might have to be considered when
   defining the starting conditions for molecular dynamics simulation
   studies of protein folding.},

Title = {Mutations in a Helix-1 Motif of the ATP Synthase c-Subunit of Bacillus

Abstract = {The ATP synthase of the alkaliphile Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 has a
   tridecameric c-subunit rotor ring. Each c-subunit has an AxAxAxA motif
   near the center of the inner helix, where neutralophilic bacteria
   generally have a GxGxGxG motif. Here, we studied the impact of four
   single and six multiple Ala-to-Gly chromosomal mutations in the
   A16xAxAxA22 motif on the capacity for nonfermentative growth and, for
   most of the mutants, on ATP synthesis by ADP- and P(i)-loaded membrane
   vesicles at pH 7.5 and 10.5. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analyses of the holo-ATP synthases were used
   to probe stability of the mutant c-rotors and mobility properties of the
   c-rotors as well as the monomeric c-subunits that are released from them
   by trichloroacetic acid treatment. Mutants containing an Ala16-to-Gly
   mutation exhibited the most severe functional defects. Via SDS PAGE,
   most of the mutant c-monomers exhibited increased mobility relative to
   the wildtype (WT) c-subunit, but among the intact c-rings, only
   Ala16-to-Gly mutants exhibited significantly increased mobility relative
   to that of the WT c-ring. The hypothesis that these c-rings have a
   decreased c-subunit stoichiometry is still untested, but the functional
   impact of an Ala16-to-Gly mutation clearly depended upon additional
   Ala-to-Gly mutation(s) and their positions. The A16/20G double mutant
   exhibited a larger functional deficit than both the A16G and A16/18G
   mutants. Most of the mutant c-rings showed in vitro instability relative
   to that of the WT c-ring. However, the functional deficits of mutants
   did not correlate well with the extent of c-ring stability loss, so this
   property is unlikely to be a major factor in vivo.},

Abstract = {Both the genomes of the epsilonproteobacteria Wolinella succinogenes and
   Campylobacter jejuni contain operons (sdhABE) that encode for so far
   uncharacterized enzyme complexes annotated as `non-classical'
   succinate:quinone reductases (SQRs). However, the role of such an enzyme
   ostensibly involved in aerobic respiration in an anaerobic organism such
   as W. succinogenes has hitherto been unknown. We have established the
   first genetic system for the manipulation and production of a member of
   the non-classical succinate:quinone oxidoreductase family. Biochemical
   characterization of the W. succinogenes enzyme reveals that the putative
   SQR is in fact a novel methylmenaquinol:fumarate reductase (MFR) with no
   detectable succinate oxidation activity, clearly indicative of its
   involvement in anaerobic metabolism. We demonstrate that the hydrophilic
   subunits of the MFR complex are, in contrast to all other previously
   characterized members of the superfamily, exported into the periplasm
   via the twin-arginine translocation (tat)-pathway. Furthermore we show
   that a single amino acid exchange (Ala86 -> His) in the flavoprotein of
   that enzyme complex is the only additional requirement for the covalent
   binding of the otherwise non-covalently bound FAD. Our results provide
   an explanation for the previously published puzzling observation that
   the C. jejuni sdhABE operon is upregulated in an oxygen-limited
   environment as compared with microaerophilic laboratory conditions.},

Title = {Alkaliphilic bacteria with impact on industrial applications, concepts
   of early life forms, and bioenergetics of ATP synthesis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Alkaliphilic bacteria typically grow well at pH 9, with the most
   extremophilic strains growing up to pH values as high as pH 12-13.
   Interest in extreme alkaliphiles arises because they are sources of
   useful, stable enzymes, and the cells themselves can be used for
   biotechnological and other applications at high pH. In addition,
   alkaline hydrothermal vents represent an early evolutionary niche for
   alkaliphiles and novel extreme alkaliphiles have also recently been
   found in alkaline serpentinizing sites. A third focus of interest in
   alkaliphiles is the challenge raised by the use of proton-coupled ATP
   synthases for oxidative phosphorylation by non-fermentative
   alkaliphiles. This creates a problem with respect to tenets of the
   chemiosmotic model that remains the core model for the bioenergetics of
   oxidative phosphorylation. Each of these facets of alkaliphilic bacteria
   will be discussed with a focus on extremely alkaliphilic Bacillus
   strains. These alkaliphilic bacteria have provided a cogent experimental
   system to probe adaptations that enable their growth and oxidative
   phosphorylation at high pH. Adaptations are clearly needed to enable
   secreted or partially exposed enzymes or protein complexes to function
   at the high external pH. Also, alkaliphiles must maintain a cytoplasmic
   pH that is significantly lower than the pH of the outside medium. This
   protects cytoplasmic components from an external pH that is alkaline
   enough to impair their stability or function. However, the pH gradient
   across the cytoplasmic membrane, with its orientation of more acidic
   inside than outside, is in the reverse of the productive orientation for
   bioenergetic work. The reversed gradient reduces the trans-membrane
   proton-motive force available to energize ATP synthesis. Multiple
   strategies are hypothesized to be involved in enabling alkaliphiles to
   circumvent the challenge of a low bulk proton-motive force energizing
   proton-coupled ATP synthesis at high pH.},

Abstract = {Functional immobilization and lateral organization of proteins into
   micro- and nanopatterns is an important prerequisite for miniaturizing
   bioanalytical and biotechnological devices. Here, we report an approach
   for efficient site-specific protein immobilization based on enzymatic
   phosphopantetheinyl transfer (PPT) from coenzyme A (CoA)-functionalized
   glass-type surfaces to specific peptide tags. We devised a bottom-up
   surface modification approach for coupling CoA densely to a molecular
   poly(ethylene glycol) polymer brush. Site-specific enzymatic
   immobilization of proteins fused to different target peptides for the
   PPTase Sfp was confirmed by real-time label-free detection. Quantitative
   protein-protein interaction experiments confirmed that significantly
   more than 50\% of the immobilized protein was fully active. The method
   was successfully applied with different proteins. However, different
   immobilization efficiencies of PPT-based immobilization were observed
   for different peptide tags being fused to the N- and C-termini of
   proteins. On the basis of this immobilization method, we established
   photolithographic patterning of proteins into functional binary
   microstructures.},

Title = {A vascular perspective on neuronal migration},
Journal = {MECHANISMS OF DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {138},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-25},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {During CNS development and adult neurogenesis, immature neurons travel
   from the germinal zones towards their final destination using cellular
   substrates for their migration. Classically, radial glia and neuronal
   axons have been shown to act as physical scaffolds to support neuroblast
   locomotion in processes known as gliophilic and neurophilic migration,
   respectively (Hatten, 1999; Marin and Rubenstein, 2003; Rakic, 2003). In
   adulthood, long distance neuronal migration occurs in a
   glial-independent manner since radial glia cells differentiate into
   astrocytes after birth. A series of studies highlight a novel mode of
   neuronal migration that uses blood vessels as scaffolds, the so-called
   vasophilic migration. This migration mode allows neuroblast navigation
   in physiological and also pathological conditions, such as neuronal
   precursor migration after ischemic stroke or cerebral invasion of glioma
   tumor cells. Here we review the current knowledge about how vessels pave

Abstract = {Secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sALL) following chemotherapy
   and/or radiotherapy of previous malignancies represents 2-10\% of all
   cases of ALL. A 72-year-old female patient was diagnosed with acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia following chemotherapy for a diffuse large B cell
   lymphoma. Banding cytogenetics showed a t(t(5;11)(q23-31;q23) in 20 of
   the 21 metaphases examined and fluorescent in situ hybridization
   confirmed rearrangement of MLL. Long distance inverse-polymerase chain
   reaction revealed an in-frame fusion between 5'MLL and 3'PRRC1.
   Sixty-five cases of sALL associated with 11q23/MLL rearrangement,
   including 47 with a t(4;11)(q21;q23), were retrieved from the
   literature. Drug regimen used to treat the primary neoplasm was
   available for 54 patients; 52 had received a topoisomerase II inhibitor,
   known to induce MLL rearrangement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The genome of the highly infectious bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei
   harbors an atp operon that encodes an N-type rotary ATPase, in addition
   to an operon for a regular F-type rotary ATPase. The molecular
   architecture of N-type ATPases is unknown and their biochemical
   properties and cellular functions are largely unexplored. We studied the
   B. pseudomallei N1No-type ATPase and investigated the structure and ion
   specificity of its membrane-embedded c-ring rotor by single-particle
   electron cryo-microscopy. Of several amphiphilic compounds tested for
   solubilizing the complex, the choice of the low-density, low-CMC
   detergent LDAO was optimal in terms of map quality and resolution. The
   cryoEM map of the c-ring at 6.1 angstrom resolution reveals a
   heptadecameric oligomer with a molecular mass of similar to 141 kDa.
   Biochemical measurements indicate that the c(17) ring is H+ specific,
   demonstrating that the ATPase is proton-coupled. The c(17) ring
   stoichiometry results in a very high ion-to-ATP ratio of 5.7. We propose
   that this N-ATPase is a highly efficient proton pump that helps these
   melioidosis-causing bacteria to survive in the hostile, acidic
   environment of phagosomes.},

Title = {Platelet-derived growth factor triggers PKA-mediated signalling by a

Abstract = {Inflammatory glomerular kidney diseases are often accompanied with a
   massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect the
   function of the glomerular filtration barrier and contribute to
   mesangiolysis via the induction of cell death in mesangial cells.
   Intriguingly, ROS also trigger fine-tuned signalling processes that
   affect gene expression and cell proliferation or migration. To define
   such redox-driven signalling devices, a proteomics approach was
   performed to identify the formation of protein complexes induced by ROS.
   To this end, protein lysates of human podocytes were treated with or
   without hydrogen peroxide (250 mu M). Thereafter cell lysates were
   subjected to diagonal 2D gel electrophoresis and putative redox-affected
   proteins were analysed by MS/MS analysis. Among others, the regulatory
   subunit of protein kinase A (PICA) could be identified that forms
   homodimers under oxidative conditions. To evaluate whether ROS dependent
   dimerization of PICA also occurs in a more physiological setting, rat
   mesangial cells were treated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB
   (PDGF-BB) to induce ROS formation. This regimen resulted in a redox
   dependent dimerization of the R-subunits of PICA. To demonstrate whether
   PDGF-BB induced ROS formation affects PICA dependent pathways, the
   effects of PDGF-BB on phosphorylation of serine 157 of vasodilator
   stimulated protein (VASP) a classical target of PICA were analysed.
   Interestingly PDGF-BB induced VASP phosphorylation in a ROS dependent
   manner but independent of changes in cAMP levels. Taken together, we
   demonstrate a redox-mediated activation of PICA by PDGF-BB thus
   highlighting a physiological role of ROS as regulator of PICA activity
   in rat mesangial cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The C-terminal domain of Fcj1 is required for formation of crista
   junctions and interacts with the TOB/SAM complex in mitochondria},

Pages = {2143-2155},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Crista junctions (CJs) are tubular invaginations of the inner membrane
   of mitochondria that connect the inner boundary with the cristae
   membrane. These architectural elements are critical for mitochondrial
   function. The yeast inner membrane protein Fcj1, called mitofilin in
   mammals, was reported to be preferentially located at CJs and crucial
   for their formation. Here we investigate the functional roles of
   individual domains of Fcj1. The most conserved part of Fcj1, the
   C-terminal domain, is essential for Fcj1 function. In its absence,
   formation of CJ is strongly impaired and irregular, and stacked cristae
   are present. This domain interacts with full-length Fcj1, suggesting a
   role in oligomer formation. It also interacts with Tob55 of the
   translocase of outer membrane beta-barrel proteins (TOB)/sorting and
   assembly machinery (SAM) complex, which is required for the insertion of
   beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane. The association of the
   TOB/SAM complex with contact sites depends on the presence of Fcj1. The
   biogenesis of beta-barrel proteins is not significantly affected in the
   absence of Fcj1. However, down-regulation of the TOB/SAM complex leads
   to altered cristae morphology and a moderate reduction in the number of
   CJs. We propose that the C-terminal domain of Fcj1 is critical for the
   interaction of Fcj1 with the TOB/SAM complex and thereby for stabilizing
   CJs in close proximity to the outer membrane. These results assign novel
   functions to both the C-terminal domain of Fcj1 and the TOB/SAM complex.},

Abstract = {Employing hippocampal synaptosomes from amyloid precursor protein
   (APP)-deleted mice we analyzed the immediate effects of amyloid beta
   peptide 42 (A beta(42)) peptide in its oligomeric or fibrillar assembly
   or of soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPP alpha) protein on
   their bioenergetic activity. Upon administration of oligomeric A
   beta(42) peptide for 30 min we observed a robust decrease both in
   mitochondrial activity and in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). In
   contrast the respective fibrillary or scrambled peptides showed no
   effect, indicating that inhibition strictly depends on the
   oligomerization status of the peptide. Hippocampal synaptosomes from old
   APP-KO mice revealed a further reduction of their already impaired
   bioenergetic activity upon incubation with 10 mu m A beta(42) peptide.
   In addition we evaluated the influence of the sAPP alpha protein on
   mitochondrial activity of hippocampal synaptosomes derived from young or
   old APP-KO animals. In neither case 20 nm nor 200 nm sAPP alpha protein
   had an effect on mitochondrial metabolic activity. Our findings
   demonstrate that hippocampal synaptosomes derived from APP-KO mice are a
   most suitable model system to evaluate the impact of A beta(42) peptide
   on its bioenergetic activity and to further elucidate the molecular
   mechanisms underlying the impairments by oligomeric A beta(42) on
   mitochondrial function. Our data demonstrate that extracellular A
   beta(42) peptide is taken up into synaptosomes where it immediately
   attenuates mitochondrial activity.},

Abstract = {The blood?brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic platform for exchange of
   substances between the blood and the brain parenchyma, and it is an
   essential functional gatekeeper for the central nervous system (CNS).
   While it is widely recognized that BBB disruption is a hallmark of
   several neurovascular pathologies, an aspect of the BBB that has
   received somewhat less attention is the dynamic modulation of BBB
   tightness to maintain brain homeostasis in response to extrinsic
   environmental factors and physiological changes. In this review, we
   summarize how BBB integrity adjusts in critical stages along the life
   span, as well as how BBB permeability can be altered by common stressors
   derived from nutritional habits, environmental factors and psychological
   stress.},

Title = {Mitochondrion-Derived Reactive Oxygen Species Lead to Enhanced Amyloid

Abstract = {Aims: Intracellular amyloid beta (A beta) oligomers and extracellular A
   beta plaques are key players in the progression of sporadic Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). Still, the molecular signals triggering A beta production
   are largely unclear. We asked whether mitochondrion-derived reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) are sufficient to increase A beta generation and
   thereby initiate a vicious cycle further impairing mitochondrial
   function. Results: Complex I and III dysfunction was induced in a cell
   model using the respiratory inhibitors rotenone and antimycin, resulting
   in mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced ROS levels. Both treatments
   lead to elevated levels of A beta. Presence of an antioxidant rescued
   mitochondrial function and reduced formation of A beta, demonstrating
   that the observed effects depended on ROS. Conversely, cells
   overproducing A beta showed impairment of mitochondrial function such as
   comprised mitochondrial respiration, strongly altered morphology, and
   reduced intracellular mobility of mitochondria. Again, the capability of
   these cells to generate A beta was partly reduced by an antioxidant,
   indicating that A beta formation was also ROS dependent. Moreover, mice
   with a genetic defect in complex I, or AD mice treated with a complex I
   inhibitor, showed enhanced A beta levels in vivo. Innovation: We show
   for the first time that mitochondrion-derived ROS are sufficient to
   trigger A beta production in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Several
   lines of evidence show that mitochondrion-derived ROS result in enhanced
   amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein processing, and that A beta
   itself leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased ROS levels. We
   propose that starting from mitochondrial dysfunction a vicious cycle is
   triggered that contributes to the pathogenesis of sporadic AD. Antioxid.

Title = {CHIP as a membrane-shuttling proteostasis sensor},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Cells respond to protein misfolding and aggregation in the cytosol by
   adjusting gene transcription and a number of post-transcriptional
   processes. In parallel to functional reactions, cellular structure
   changes as well; however, the mechanisms underlying the early adaptation
   of cellular compartments to cytosolic protein misfolding are less clear.
   Here we show that the mammalian ubiquitin ligase C-terminal
   Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), if freed from chaperones during acute
   stress, can dock on cellular membranes thus performing a proteostasis
   sensor function. We reconstituted this process in vitro and found that
   mainly phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate enhance
   association of chaperone-free CHIP with liposomes. HSP70 and membranes
   compete for mutually exclusive binding to the tetratricopeptide repeat
   domain of CHIP. At new cellular locations, access to
   compartment-specific substrates would enable CHIP to participate in the
   reorganization of the respective organelles, as exemplified by the
   fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (effector function).},

Abstract = {We report on the assembly of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1)
   prior to ligand activation and its ligand-induced reorganization at the
   cell membrane. We apply single-molecule localization microscopy to
   obtain quantitative information on receptor cluster sizes and copy
   numbers. Our data suggest a dimeric pre-assembly of TNF-R1, as well as
   receptor reorganization toward higher oligomeric states with stable
   populations comprising three to six TNF-R1. Our experimental results
   directly serve as input parameters for computational modeling of the
   ligand-receptor interaction. Simulations corroborate the experimental
   finding of higher-order oligomeric states. This work is a first
   demonstration how quantitative, super-resolution and advanced microscopy
   can be used for systems biology approaches at the single-molecule and
   single-cell level.},

Abstract = {Mitochondrial proton-pumping NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase
   (respiratory complex I) comprises more than 40 polypeptides and contains
   eight canonical FeS clusters. The integration of subunits and insertion
   of cofactors into the nascent complex is a complicated multistep process
   that is aided by assembly factors. We show that the accessory NUMM
   subunit of complex I (human NDUFS6) harbors a Zn-binding site and
   resolve its position by X-ray crystallography. Chromosomal deletion of
   the NUMM gene or mutation of Zn-binding residues blocked a late step of
   complex I assembly. An accumulating assembly intermediate lacked
   accessory subunit N7BM (NDUFA12), whereas a paralog of this subunit, the
   assembly factor N7BML (NDUFAF2), was found firmly bound instead. EPR
   spectroscopic analysis and metal content determination after
   chromatographic purification of the assembly intermediate showed that
   NUMM is required for insertion or stabilization of FeS cluster N4.},

Abstract = {Aptamers that can be regulated with light allow precise control of
   protein activity in space and time and hence of biological function in
   general. In a previous study, we showed that the activity of the
   thrombin-binding aptamer HD1 can be turned off by irradiation using a
   light activatable `caged' intramolecular antisense-domain. However, the
   activity of the presented aptamer in its ON state was only mediocre.
   Here we studied the nature of this loss in activity in detail and found
   that switching from 5'- to 3'-extensions affords aptamers that are even
   more potent than the unmodified HD1. In particular we arrived at
   derivatives that are now more active than the aptamer NU172 that is
   currently in phase 2 clinical trials as an anticoagulant. As a result,
   we present light-regulatable aptamers with a superior activity in their
   ON state and an almost digital ON/OFF behavior upon irradiation.},

Title = {Amicyanin Transfers Electrons from Methylamine Dehydrogenase to
   Cytochrome c-551i via a Ping-Pong Mechanism, not a Ternary Complex},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY},

Volume = {132},

Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {The first crystal structure of a ternary redox protein complex was
   comprised of the enzyme methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) and two
   electron transfer proteins, amicyanin and cytochrome c-551i from
   Paracoccus denitrificans {[}Chen et al. Science 1994, 264, 86-90]. The
   arrangement of the proteins suggested possible electron transfer from
   the active site of MADH via the amicyanin copper ion to the cytochrome
   heme iron, although the distance between the metals is large. We studied
   the interactions between these proteins in solution. A titration
   followed by NMR spectroscopy shows that amicyanin binds cytochrome
   c-551i. The interface comprises the hydrophobic and positive patches of
   amicyanin, not the binding site observed in the ternary complex. NMR
   experiments further show that amicyanin binds tightly to MADH with an
   interface that matches the one observed in the crystal structure and
   that mostly overlaps with the binding site for cytochrome c-551i. Upon
   addition of cytochrome c-551i, no changes in the NMR spectrum of
   MADH-bound amicyanin are observed, suggesting that a possible
   interaction of the cytochrome with the binary complex must be very weak,
   with a dissociation constant higher than 2 mM. Reconstitution of the
   entire redox chain in vitro demonstrates that amicyanin can react
   rapidly with cytochrome c-551i, but that association of amicyanin with
   MADH inhibits this reaction. It is concluded that electron transfer from
   MADH to cytochrome c-551i does not involve a ternary complex but occurs
   via a ping-pong mechanism in which amicyanin uses the same interface for
   the reactions with MADH and cytochrome c-551i.},

Title = {Mitophagy in yeast is independent of mitochondrial fission and requires

Year = {2011},
Volume = {124},

Pages = {1339-1350},

Abstract = {Dysfunctional mitochondria show a reduced capacity for fusion and, as
   mitochondrial fission is maintained, become spatially separated from the
   intact network. By that mechanism, dysfunctional mitochondria have been
   proposed to be targeted for selective degradation by mitophagy, thereby
   providing a quality control system for mitochondria. In yeast,
   conflicting results concerning the role of mitochondrial dynamics in
   mitophagy have been reported. Here, we investigate the effects on
   mitophagy of altering mitochondrial fission and fusion, using
   biochemical, as well as fluorescence-based, assays. Rapamycin-induced
   mitophagy was shown to depend upon the autophagy-related proteins Atg11,
   Atg20 and Atg24, confirming that a selective type of autophagy occurred.
   Both fragmentation of mitochondria and inhibition of oxidative
   phosphorylation were not sufficient to trigger mitophagy, and neither
   deletion of the fission factors Dnm1, Fis1, Mdv1 or Caf4 nor expression
   of dominant-negative variants of Dnm1 impaired mitophagy. The diminished
   mitophagy initially observed in a Delta fis1 mutant was not due to the
   absence of Fis1 but rather due to a secondary mutation in WHI2, which
   encodes a factor reported to function in the general stress response and
   the Ras-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. We propose that, in
   yeast, mitochondrial fission is not a prerequisite for the selective
   degradation of mitochondria, and that mitophagy is linked to the general
   stress response and the Ras-PKA signaling pathway.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {During mammalian blastocyst development, inner cell mass (ICM) cells
   differentiate into epiblast (Epi) or primitive endoderm (PrE). These two
   fates are characterized by the expression of the transcription factors
   NANOG and GATA6, respectively. Here, we investigate the spatio-temporal
   distribution of NANOG and GATA6 expressing cells in the ICM of the mouse
   blastocysts with quantitative three-dimensional single cell-based
   neighbourhood analyses. We define the cell neighbourhood by local
   features, which include the expression levels of both fate markers
   expressed in each cell and its neighbours, and the number of
   neighbouring cells. We further include the position of a cell relative
   to the centre of the ICM as a global positional feature. Our analyses
   reveal a local three-dimensional pattern that is already present in
   early blastocysts: 1) Cells expressing the highest NANOG levels are
   surrounded by approximately nine neighbours, while 2) cells expressing
   GATA6 cluster according to their GATA6 levels. This local pattern
   evolves into a global pattern in the ICM that starts to emerge in mid
   blastocysts. We show that FGF/MAPK signalling is involved in the
   three-dimensional distribution of the cells and, using a mutant
   background, we further show that the GATA6 neighbourhood is regulated by
   NANOG. Our quantitative study suggests that the three-dimensional cell
   neighbourhood plays a role in Epi and PrE precursor specification. Our
   results highlight the importance of analysing the three-dimensional cell
   neighbourhood while investigating cell fate decisions during early mouse
   embryonic development.},

Title = {Mutational Analysis of the QRRQ Motif in the Yeast Hig1 Type 2 Protein
   Rcf1 Reveals a Regulatory Role for the Cytochrome c Oxidase Complex},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {292},

Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {The yeast Rcf1 protein is a member of the conserved family of proteins
   termed the hypoxia-induced gene (domain) 1 (Hig1 or HIGD1) family. Rcf1
   interacts with components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
   system, in particular the cytochrome bc(1) (complex III)-cytochrome c
   oxidase (complex IV) supercomplex (termed III-IV) and the ADP/ATP
   carrier proteins. Rcf1 plays a role in the assembly and modulation of
   the activity of complex IV; however, the molecular basis for how Rcf1
   influences the activity of complex IV is currently unknown. Hig1 type 2
   isoforms, which include the Rcf1 protein, are characterized in part by
   the presence of a conserved motif, (Q/I) X-3(R/H) XRX(3)Q, termed here
   the QRRQ motif. We show that mutation of conserved residues within the
   Rcf1 QRRQ motif alters the interactions between Rcf1 and partner
   proteins and results in the destabilization of complex IV and alteration
   of its enzymatic properties. Our findings indicate that Rcf1 does not
   serve as a stoichiometric component, i.e. as a subunit of complex IV, to
   support its activity. Rather, we propose that Rcf1 serves to dynamically
   interact with complex IV during its assembly process and, in doing so,
   regulates a late maturation step of complex IV. We speculate that the
   Rcf1/Hig1 proteins play a role in the incorporation and/or remodeling of
   lipids, in particular cardiolipin, into complex IV and. possibly, other
   mitochondrial proteins such as ADP/ATP carrier proteins.},

Abstract = {The impact of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) on studies of large
   macromolecular complexes hinges on improvements in sensitivity and
   resolution. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the solid state can
   offer improved sensitivity, provided sample preparation is optimized to
   preserve spectral resolution. For a few nanomoles of intact ribosomes
   and an 800 kDa ribosomal complex we demonstrate that the combination of
   DNP and magic-angle spinning NMR (MAS-NMR) allows one to overcome
   current sensitivity limitations so that homo- and heteronuclear C-13 and
   N-15 NMR correlation spectra can be recorded. Ribosome particles,
   directly pelleted and frozen into an NMR rotor, yield DNP signal
   enhancements on the order of similar to 25-fold and spectra that exhibit
   narrow linewidths, suitable for obtaining site-specific information. We
   anticipate that the same approach is applicable to other high molecular
   weight complexes.},

Abstract = {The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its mammalian homologs, APLP1,
   APLP2, have been allocated to an organellar pool residing in the Golgi
   apparatus and in endosomal compartments, and in its mature form to a
   cell surface-localized pool. In the brain, all APPs are restricted to
   neurons; however, their precise localization at the plasma membrane
   remained enigmatic. Employing a variety of subcellular fractionation
   steps, we isolated two synaptic vesicle (SV) pools from rat and mouse
   brain, a pool consisting of synaptic vesicles only and a pool comprising
   SV docked to the presynaptic plasma membrane. Immunopurification of
   these two pools using a monoclonal antibody directed against the 12
   membrane span synaptic vesicle protein2 (SV2) demonstrated unambiguously
   that APP, APLP1 and APLP2 are constituents of the active zone of murine
   brain but essentially absent from free synaptic vesicles. The
   specificity of immunodetection was confirmed by analyzing the respective
   knock-out animals. The fractionation experiments further revealed that
   APP is accumulated in the fraction containing docked synaptic vesicles.
   These data present novel insights into the subsynaptic localization of
   APPs and are a prerequisite for unraveling the physiological role of all
   mature APP proteins in synaptic physiology.},

Abstract = {In many biochemical processes, proteins need to bind partners amidst a
   sea of other molecules. Generally, partner selection is achieved by
   formation of a single-orientation complex with well-defined, short-range
   interactions. We describe a protein network that functions effectively
   in a metabolic electron transfer process but lacks such specific
   interactions. The soil bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans oxidizes a
   variety of compounds by channeling electrons into the main respiratory
   pathway. Upon conversion of methylamine by methylamine dehydrogenase,
   electrons are transported to the terminal oxidase to reduce molecular
   oxygen. Steady-state kinetic measurements and NMR experiments
   demonstrate a remarkable number of possibilities for the electron
   transfer, involving the cupredoxin amicyanin as well as four c-type
   cytochromes. The observed interactions appear to be governed exclusively
   by the electrostatic nature of each of the proteins. It is concluded
   that Paracoccus provides a pool of cytochromes for efficient electron
   transfer via weak, ill-defined interactions, in contrast with the view
   that functional biochemical interactions require well-defined molecular
   interactions. It is proposed that the lack of requirement for
   specificity in these interactions might facilitate the integration of
   new metabolic pathways.},

Abstract = {The microscopic mechanism of coupled c-ring rotation and ion
   translocation in F1F0-ATP synthases is unknown. Here we present
   conclusive evidence supporting the notion that the ability of c-rings to
   rotate within the F-0 complex derives from the interplay between the
   ion-binding sites and their nonhomogenous microenvironment. This
   evidence rests on three atomic structures of the c(15) rotor from
   crystals grown at low pH, soaked at high pH and, after
   N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) modification, resolved at 1.8, 3.0
   and 2.2 angstrom, respectively. Alongside a quantitative DCCD-labeling
   assay and free-energy molecular dynamics calculations, these data
   demonstrate how the thermodynamic stability of the so-called
   proton-locked state is maximized by the lipid membrane. By contrast, a
   hydrophilic environment at the a-subunit-c-ring interface appears to
   unlock the binding-site conformation and promotes proton exchange with
   the surrounding solution. Rotation thus occurs as c-subunits
   stochastically alternate between these environments, directionally
   biased by the electrochemical transmembrane gradient.},

Title = {PHD3 regulates EGFR internalization and signalling in tumours},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Tumours exploit their hypoxic microenvironment to induce a more
   aggressive phenotype, while curtailing the growth-inhibitory effects of
   hypoxia through mechanisms that are poorly understood. The prolyl
   hydroxylase PHD3 is regulated by hypoxia and plays an important role in
   tumour progression. Here we identify PHD3 as a central regulator of
   epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity through the control of
   EGFR internalization to restrain tumour growth. PHD3 controls EGFR
   activity by acting as a scaffolding protein that associates with the
   endocytic adaptor Eps15 and promotes the internalization of EGFR. In
   consequence, loss of PHD3 in tumour cells suppresses EGFR
   internalization and hyperactivates EGFR signalling to enhance cell
   proliferation and survival. Our findings reveal that PHD3 inactivation
   provides a novel route of EGFR activation to sustain proliferative
   signalling in the hypoxic microenvironment.},

Abstract = {Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 (KR2) is a pentameric, light-driven
   ion pump, which selectively transports sodium or protons. The mechanism
   of ion selectivity and transfer is unknown. By using conventional as
   well as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced solid-state NMR, we
   were able to analyse the retinal polyene chain between positions C10 and
   C15 as well as the Schiff base nitrogen in the KR2 resting state. In
   addition, 50\% of the KR2 C-13 and N-15 resonances could be assigned by
   multidimensional high-field solid-state NMR experiments. Assigned
   residues include part of the NDQ motif as well as sodium binding sites.
   Based on these data, the structural effects of the H30A mutation, which
   seems to shift the ion selectivity of KR2 primarily to Na+, could be
   analysed. Our data show that it causes long-range effects within the

Abstract = {This protocol details a culture technique for neonatal mouse retina that
   allows the assessment and quantification of acute responses of
   developing blood vessels to pharmacological manipulation. The technique
   has proven to be a useful tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms
   that underlie the guidance of tip cells in the complex scenario of the
   angiogenic sprouting process. This culture setting allows the acute
   stimulation or inhibition of cellular functions of endothelial cells in
   their physiological environment ex vivo. Compared with other existing
   techniques, such as retinal injections in animals, the explant culture
   described here is an easily manageable and highly flexible alternative
   that allows pharmacological manipulations of the developing retina
   vessels. The technique involves swift extraction of retina from intact
   eye and retinal flat mounting on a hydrophilic membrane with minimum
   disturbance of the tissue. The responses of tip endothelial cell
   sprouting activity and filopodial extension to different angiogenic and
   angioinhibitory factors can be evaluated within only 4 h. The whole
   process for the retinal explant cultures and stimulation can be
   completed in 10 h.},

Abstract = {During mammalian preimplantation, cells of the inner cell mass (ICM)
   adopt either an embryonic or an extraembryonic fate. This process is
   tightly regulated in space and time and has been studied previously in
   mouse embryos and embryonic stem cell models. Current research suggests
   that cell fates are arranged in a salt-and-pepper pattern of random cell
   positioning or a spatially alternating pattern. However, the details of
   the three-dimensional patterns of cell fate specification have not been
   investigated in the embryo nor in in vitro systems. We developed ICM
   organoids as a, to our knowledge, novel three-dimensional in vitro stem
   cell system to model mechanisms of fate decisions that occur in the ICM.
   ICM organoids show similarities to the in vivo system that arise
   regardless of the differences in geometry and total cell number.
   Inspecting ICM organoids and mouse embryos, we describe a so far unknown
   local clustering of cells with identical fates in both systems. These
   findings are based on the three-dimensional quantitative analysis of
   spatiotemporal patterns of NANOG and GATA6 expression in combination
   with computational rule-based modeling. The pattern identified by our
   analysis is distinct from the current view of a salt-and-pepper pattern.
   Our investigation of the spatial distributions both in vivo and in vitro
   dissects the contributions of the different parts of the embryo to cell
   fate specifications. In perspective, our combination of quantitative in
   vivo and in vitro analyses can be extended to other mammalian organisms
   and thus creates a powerful approach to study embryogenesis.},

Journal = {CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Pages = {971-980},
Abstract = {The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has previously been allocated to an
   organellar pool residing in the Golgi apparatus and in endosomal
   compartments, and in its mature form to a presynaptic active
   zone-localized pool. By analyzing homozygous APP knockout mice we
   evaluated the impact of APP on synaptic vesicle protein abundance at
   synaptic release sites. Following immunopurification of synaptic
   vesicles and the attached presynaptic plasma membrane, individual
   proteins were subjected to quantitative Western blot analysis. We
   demonstrate that APP deletion in knockout animals reduces the abundance
   of the synaptic vesicle proteins synaptophysin, synaptotagmin-1, and
   SV2A at the presynaptic active zone. Conversely, deletion of the
   additional APP family members, APLP1 and APLP2 resulted in an increase
   in synaptophysin, synaptogamin-1, and SV2A abundance. When transmembrane
   APP is lacking in APPs alpha-KI/APLP2-KO mice synaptic vesicle protein
   abundance corresponds to that in APP -KO mice. Deletion of the synaptic
   vesicle protein 2 (SV2) A and B had no effect on APP and synaptophysin
   abundance but decreased synaptotagmin-1. Our data suggest that APP
   controls the abundance of synaptic vesicle proteins at the presynaptic
   release sites and thus impacts synaptic transmission.},

Abstract = {Proteorhodopsin (PR) is the most abundant retinal protein on earth and
   functions as a light-driven proton pump. Despite extensive efforts,
   structural data for PR photointermediate states have not been obtained.
   On the basis of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced solid-state
   NMR, we were able to analyze the retinal polyene chain between positions
   C10 and C15 as well as the Schiff base nitrogen in the ground state in
   comparison to light-induced, cryotrapped K- and M-states. A high M-state
   population could be achieved by preventing reprotonation of the Schiff
   base through a mutation of the primary proton donor (E108Q). Our data
   reveal unexpected large and alternating C-13 chemical shift changes in
   the K-state propagating away from the Schiff base along the polyene
   chain. Furthermore, two different M-states have been observed reflecting
   the Schiff base reorientation after the deprotonation step. Our study
   provides novel insight into the photocycle of PR and also demonstrates
   the power of DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR to bridge the gap between
   functional and structural data and models.},

Title = {Trans-Golgi network localized small GTPase RabA1d is involved in cell
   plate formation and oscillatory root hair growth},
Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Background: Small Rab GTPases are important regulators of vesicular
   trafficking in plants. AtRabA1d, a member of the RabA1 subfamily of
   small GTPases, was previously found in the vesicle-rich apical dome of
   growing root hairs suggesting a role during tip growth; however, its
   specific intracellular localization and role in plants has not been well
   described.
   Results: The transient expression of 35S::GFP:RabA1d construct in Allium
   porrum and Nicotiana benthamiana revealed vesicular structures, which
   were further corroborated in stable transformed Arabidopsis thaliana
   plants. GFP-RabA1d colocalized with the trans-Golgi network marker
   mCherry-VTI12 and with early FM4-64-labeled endosomal compartments. Late
   endosomes and endoplasmic reticulum labeled with FYVE-DsRed and
   ER-DsRed, respectively, were devoid of GFP-RabA1d. The accumulation of
   GFP-RabA1d in the core of brefeldin A (BFA)-induced-compartments and the
   quantitative upregulation of RabA1d protein levels after BFA treatment
   confirmed the association of RabA1d with early endosomes/TGN and its
   role in vesicle trafficking. Light-sheet microscopy revealed involvement
   of RabA1d in root development. In root cells, GFP-RabA1d followed cell
   plate expansion consistently with cytokinesis-related vesicular
   trafficking and membrane recycling. GFP-RabA1d accumulated in disc-like
   structures of nascent cell plates, which progressively evolved to
   marginal ring-like structures of the growing cell plates. During root
   hair growth and development, GFP-RabA1d was enriched at root hair bulges
   and at the apical dome of vigorously elongating root hairs. Importantly,
   GFP-RabA1d signal intensity exhibited an oscillatory behavior in-phase
   with tip growth. Progressively, this tip localization dissapeared in
   mature root hairs suggesting a link between tip localization of RabA1d
   and root hair elongation. Our results support a RabA1d role in events
   that require vigorous membrane trafficking.
   Conclusions: RabA1d is located in early endosomes/TGN and is involved in
   vesicle trafficking. RabA1d participates in both cell plate formation
   and root hair oscillatory tip growth. The specific GFP-RabA1d
   subcellular localization confirms a correlation between its specific
   spatio-temporal accumulation and local vesicle trafficking requirements
   during cell plate and root hair formation.},

Abstract = {Proton-pumping respiratory complex I is one of the largest and most
   complicated membrane protein complexes. Its function is critical for
   efficient energy supply in aerobic cells, and malfunctions are
   implicated in many neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report an x-ray
   crystallographic analysis of mitochondrial complex I. The positions of
   all iron-sulfur clusters relative to the membrane arm were determined in
   the complete enzyme complex. The ubiquinone reduction site resides close
   to 30 angstroms above the membrane domain. The arrangement of functional
   modules suggests conformational coupling of redox chemistry with proton
   pumping and essentially excludes direct mechanisms. We suggest that a
   similar to 60-angstrom-long helical transmission element is critical for
   transducing conformational energy to proton-pumping elements in the
   distal module of the membrane arm.},

Title = {Modulation of TAP-dependent antigen compartmentalization during human

Journal = {BLOOD ADVANCES},

Volume = {3},
Number = {6},
Pages = {839-850},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) take up antigen in the periphery, migrate to
   secondary lymphoid organs, and present processed antigen fragments to
   adaptive immune cells and thus prime antigen-specific immunity. During
   local inflammation, recirculating monocytes are recruited from blood to
   the inflamed tissue, where they differentiate to macrophages and DCs. In
   this study, we found that monocytes showed high transporter associated
   with antigen processing (TAP)-dependent peptide compartmentalization and
   that after antigen pulsing, they were not able to efficiently stimulate
   antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Nevertheless, upon in vitro
   differentiation to monocyte-derived DCs, TAP-dependent peptide
   compartmentalization as well as surface major histocompatibility complex
   I turnover decreased and the cells efficiently restimulated T
   lymphocytes. Although TAP-dependent peptide compartmentalization
   decreased during DC differentiation, TAP expression levels increased.
   Furthermore, TAP relocated from early endosomes in monocytes to the
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomal compartments in DCs.
   Collectively, these data are compatible with the model that during
   monocyte-to-DC differentiation, the subcellular relocation of TAP and
   the regulation of its activity assure spatiotemporal separation of local
   antigen uptake and processing by monocytes and efficient T-lymphocyte
   stimulation by DCs.},

Title = {Two independent gene signatures in pediatric t(4;11) acute lymphoblastic

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {83},
Number = {5},
Pages = {406-419},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective:
   Gene expression profiles become increasingly more important for
   diagnostic procedures, allowing clinical predictions including treatment
   response and outcome. However, the establishment of specific and robust
   gene signatures from microarray data sets requires the analysis of large
   numbers of patients and the application of complex biostatistical
   algorithms. Especially in case of rare diseases and due to these
   constrains, diagnostic centers with limited access to patients or
   bioinformatic resources are excluded from implementing these new
   technologies.
   Method:
   In our study we sought to overcome these limitations and for proof of
   principle, we analyzed the rare t(4;11) leukemia disease entity. First,
   gene expression data of each t(4;11) leukemia patient were normalized by
   pairwise subtraction against normal bone marrow (n = 3) to identify
   significantly deregulated gene sets for each patient.
   Result:
   A `core signature' of 186 commonly deregulated genes present in each
   investigated t(4;11) leukemia patient was defined. Linking the obtained
   gene sets to four biological discriminators (HOXA gene expression, age
   at diagnosis, fusion gene transcripts and chromosomal breakpoints)
   divided patients into two distinct subgroups: the first one comprised
   infant patients with low HOXA genes expression and the MLL breakpoints
   within introns 11/12. The second one comprised non-infant patients with
   high HOXA expression and MLL breakpoints within introns 9/10.
   Conclusion:
   A yet homogeneous leukemia entity was further subdivided, based on
   distinct genetic properties. This approach provided a simplified way to
   obtain robust and disease-specific gene signatures even in smaller
   cohorts.},

Abstract = {Proton-pumping complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is among
   the largest and most complicated membrane protein complexes. The enzyme
   contributes substantially to oxidative energy conversion in eukaryotic
   cells. Its malfunctions are implicated in many hereditary and
   degenerative disorders. We report the x-ray structure of mitochondrial
   complex I at a resolution of 3.6 to 3.9 angstroms, describing in detail
   the central subunits that execute the bioenergetic function. A
   continuous axis of basic and acidic residues running centrally through
   the membrane arm connects the ubiquinone reduction site in the
   hydrophilic arm to four putative proton-pumping units. The binding
   position for a substrate analogous inhibitor and blockage of the
   predicted ubiquinone binding site provide a model for the ``deactive{''}
   form of the enzyme. The proposed transition into the active form is
   based on a concerted structural rearrangement at the ubiquinone
   reduction site, providing support for a two-state stabilization-change
   mechanism of proton pumping.},

   development of the clinical phenotype of hereditary nonpolyposis
   colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome). Here, we describe the discovery and
   first functional characterization of a novel germline MLH1 mutant
   allele.
   Experimental Design: A large kindred including 54 potential carriers was
   investigated at the molecular level by using different types of PCR
   experiments, gene cloning, transfection studies, Western blot
   experiments, and mismatch repair assays to identify and characterize a
   novel MLH1 mutant allele. Twenty-two of 54 putative carriers developed
   colon cancer or other tumors, including breast cancer.
   Results: The identified MLH1 mutant allele emerged from an interstitial
   deletion on chromosome 3p21.3, leading to an in-frame fusion of MLH1
   (exons 1-11) with ITGA9 (integrin alpha 9; exons 17-28). The deleted
   area has a size of about 400 kb; codes for LRRFIP2 (leucine-rich repeat
   in flightless interaction protein 2), GOLGA4 (Golgi autoantigen, golgin
   subfamily a, 4), and C3orf35/APRG1 (chromosome 3 open reading frame
   35/AP20 region protein 1); and partly disrupts the AP20 region
   implicated in major epithelial malignancies. Tumor cells lost their
   second MLH1 allele. The MLH1 circle ITGA9 fusion protein provides no
   capability for DNA mismatch repair. Murine fibroblasts, expressing a
   doxycycline-inducible MLH1 circle ITGA9 fusion gene, exhibit a
   loss-of-contact inhibition phenotype.
   Conclusions: This is the first description of a functional gene fusion
   of the human MLH1 gene, resulting in the loss of mismatch repair
   capabilities. The MLH1 circle ITGA9 fusion allele, together with
   deletions of the AP20 region, presumably defines a novel subclass of
   Lynch syndrome patients, which results in an extended tumor spectrum
   known from hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and Muir-Torre
   syndrome patients.},

Abstract = {We report here the use of methyl NMR spectroscopy with a
   selective-excitation pulsing scheme to extract structural information
   about a ribosome-bound nascent chain, a complex with a molecular weight
   of more than 2 MDa and a sample concentration in the micromolar range.
   The carbon chemical shifts of methyl groups are particularly sensitive
   to the development of the tertiary structure of a protein it folds, and
   crucially for systems that are at the Limit of acceptable
   signal-to-noise-ratios, methyl group spectroscopy has higher sensitivity
   than does backbone amide group-based NMR spectroscopy. Comparison of the
   side-chain methyl correlations of the ribosome-bound nascent chain to
   previously obtained backbone amide correlations reveals dynamical
   perturbations within the hydrophobic core of the folded domain, which
   are attributed to motional restriction of the nascent chain as a result
   of ribosome attachment. Methyl NMR spectroscopy therefore provides
   improved spectral quality and complementary structural information to
   that of the amide groups and hence promises to provide a greatly
   enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of cotranslational folding
   at atomic resolution.},

Title = {Mitochondrial DNA copy number and function decrease with age in the

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Among vertebrates that can be kept in captivity, the annual fish
   Nothobranchius furzeri possesses the shortest known lifespan. It also
   shows typical signs of aging and is therefore an ideal model to assess
   the role of different physiological and environmental parameters on
   aging and lifespan determination. Here, we used Nothobranchius furzeri
   to study whether aging is associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   alterations and changes in mitochondrial function. We sequenced the
   complete mitochondrial genome of N. furzeri and found an extended
   control region. Large-scale mtDNA deletions have been frequently
   described to accumulate in other organisms with age, but there was no
   evidence for the presence of detectable age-related mtDNA deletions in
   N. furzeri. However, mtDNA copy number significantly decreased with age
   in skeletal muscle, brain, liver, skin and dorsal fin. Consistent with
   this finding, expression of Pgc-1 alpha that encodes a transcriptional
   coactivator of mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of Tfam and
   mtSsbp both encoding mtDNA binding factors was downregulated with age.
   The investigation of possible changes in mitochondrial function revealed
   that the content of respiratory chain complexes III and IV was reduced
   in skeletal muscle with age. In addition, ADP-stimulated and
   succinate-dependent respiration was decreased in mitochondria of old
   fish. These findings suggest that despite the short lifespan, aging in
   N. furzeri is associated with a decline in mtDNA copy number, the
   downregulation of mtDNA-associated genes and an impairment of
   mitochondrial function.},

Abstract = {Respiratory complex I catalyses the reduction of ubiquinone (Q) from
   NADH coupled to proton pumping across the inner membrane of
   mitochondria. The electrical charging of the inner mitochondrial
   membrane drives the synthesis of ATP, which is used to power biochemical
   reactions of the cell. The recent surge in structural data on complex I
   from bacteria and mitochondria have contributed to significant
   understanding of its molecular architecture. However, despite these
   accomplishments, the role of various subdomains in redox-coupled proton
   pumping remains entirely unclear. In this work, we have mutated
   conserved residues in the loop of the PSST subunit that faces the
   similar to 30 angstrom long unique Q-binding tunnel of respiratory
   complex I. The data show a drastic decrease in Q reductase activity upon
   mutating several residues despite full assembly of the complex.
   In-silico modeling and multiple microsecond long molecular dynamics
   simulations of wild-type and enzyme variants with exchanges of conserved
   arginine residues revealed remarkable ejection of the bound Q from the
   site near terminal electron donor N2. Based on experiments and long-time
   scale molecular simulations, we identify microscopic elements that
   dynamically control the diffusion of Q and are central to redox-coupled
   proton pumping in respiratory complex I.},

Abstract = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be required for
   the action of antidepressant therapies but its impact on brain synaptic
   function is poorly characterized. Using a combination of
   electrophysiological, single-molecule imaging and conditional transgenic
   approaches, we identified the molecular basis of the VEGF effect on
   synaptic transmission and plasticity. VEGF increases the postsynaptic
   responses mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate type of glutamate
   receptors (GluNRs) in hippocampal neurons. This is concurrent with the
   formation of new synapses and with the synaptic recruitment of GluNR
   expressing the GluN2B subunit (GluNR-2B). VEGF induces a rapid
   redistribution of GluNR-2B at synaptic sites by increasing the surface
   dynamics of these receptors within the membrane. Consistently, silencing
   the expression of the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in neural cells impairs
   hippocampaldependent synaptic plasticity and consolidation of emotional
   memory. These findings demonstrated the direct implication of VEGF
   signaling in neurons via VEGFR2 in proper synaptic function. They
   highlight the potential of VEGF as a key regulator of GluNR synaptic
   function and suggest a role for VEGF in new therapeutic approaches
   targeting GluNR in depression.},

Title = {Conformation space of a heterodimeric ABC exporter under turnover

Abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has the capacity to capture molecular
   machines in action(1-3). ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters are highly
   dynamic membrane proteins that extrude a wide range of substances from
   the cytosol(4-6) and thereby contribute to essential cellular processes,
   adaptive immunity and multidrug resistance(7,8). Despite their
   importance, the coupling of nucleotide binding, hydrolysis and release
   to the conformational dynamics of these proteins remains poorly
   resolved, especially for heterodimeric and/or asymmetric ABC exporters
   that are abundant in humans. Here we present eight high-resolution
   cryo-EM structures that delineate the full functional cycle of an
   asymmetric ABC exporter in a lipid environment. Cryo-EM analysis under
   active turnover conditions reveals distinct inward-facing (IF)
   conformations-one of them with a bound peptide substrate-and previously
   undescribed asymmetric post-hydrolysis states with dimerized
   nucleotide-binding domains and a closed extracellular gate. By
   decreasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis, we could capture an
   outward-facing (OF) open conformation-an otherwise transient state
   vulnerable to substrate re-entry. The ATP-bound pre-hydrolysis and
   vanadate-trapped states are conformationally equivalent; both comprise
   co-existing OF conformations with open and closed extracellular gates.
   By contrast, the post-hydrolysis states from the turnover experiment
   exhibit asymmetric ATP and ADP occlusion after phosphate release from
   the canonical site and display a progressive separation of the
   nucleotide-binding domains and unlocking of the intracellular gate. Our
   findings reveal that phosphate release, not ATP hydrolysis, triggers the
   return of the exporter to the IF conformation. By mapping the
   conformational landscape during active turnover, aided by mutational and
   chemical modulation of kinetic rates to trap the key intermediates, we
   resolved fundamental steps of the substrate translocation cycle of
   asymmetric ABC transporters.},

Title = {Camptothecin and its analog SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan,
   inhibit binding of the transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein FUBP1
   to its DNA target sequence FUSE},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {146},

Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The transcriptional regulator FUSE Binding Protein 1 (FUBP1) is
   overexpressed in more than 80\% of all human hepatocellular carcinomas
   (HCCs) and other solid tumor entities including prostate and colorectal
   carcinoma. FUBP1 expression is required for HCC tumor cell expansion,
   and it functions as an important pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic
   oncoprotein that binds to the single-stranded DNA sequence FUSE to
   regulate the transcription of a variety of target genes. In this study,
   we screened an FDA-approved drug library and discovered that the
   Topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) and its derivative
   7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), the active irinotecan metabolite
   that is used in the clinics in combination with other chemotherapeutics
   to treat carcinoma, inhibit FUBP1 activity. Both molecules prevent in
   vitro the binding of FUBP1 to its single-stranded target DNA FUSE, and
   they induce deregulation of FUBPI target genes in HCC cells. Our results
   suggest the interference with the FUBPI/FUSE interaction as a further
   molecular mechanism that, in addition to the inactivation of TOP1, may
   contribute to the therapeutic potential of CPT/SN-38. Targeting of FUBP1
   in HCC therapy with SN-38/irinotecan could be a particularly interesting
   option because of the high FUBP1 levels in HCC cells and their
   dependency on FUBP1 expression. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Here we identified a hydrophobic 6.4 kDa protein, Cox26, as a novel
   component of yeast mitochondrial supercomplex comprising respiratory
   complexes III and IV. Multi-dimensional native and denaturing
   electrophoretic techniques were used to identify proteins interacting
   with Cox26. The majority of the Cox26 protein was found non-covalently
   bound to the complex IV moiety of the III-IV supercomplexes. A
   population of Cox26 was observed to exist in a disulfide bond
   partnership with the Cox2 subunit of complex IV. No pronounced growth
   phenotype for Cox26 deficiency was observed, indicating that Cox26 may
   not play a critical role in the COX enzymology, and we speculate that
   Cox26 may serve to regulate or support the Cox2 protein. Respiratory
   supercomplexes are assembled in the absence of the Cox26 protein,
   however their pattern slightly differs to the wild type III-IV
   supercomplex appearance. The catalytic activities of complexes III and
   IV were observed to be normal and respiration was comparable to wild
   type as long as cells were cultivated under normal growth conditions.
   Stress conditions, such as elevated temperatures resulted in mild
   decrease of respiration in non-fermentative media when the Cox26 protein
   was absent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Despite decades of work, much remains elusive about molecular events at
   the interplay between physiological and structural changes underlying
   neuronal plasticity. Here, we combined repetitive live imaging and
   expansion microscopy in organotypic brain slice cultures to
   quantitatively characterize the dynamic changes of the intracellular
   versus surface pools of GluA2-containing
   alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors
   (AMPARs) across the different dendritic spine types and the shaft during
   hippocampal homeostatic plasticity. Mechanistically, we identify
   ephrinB2 and glutamate receptor interacting protein (GRIP) 1 as
   mediating AMPAR relocation to the mushroom spine surface following
   lesion-induced denervation. Moreover, stimulation with the ephrinB2
   specific receptor EphB4 not only prevents the lesion-induced
   disappearance of mushroom spines but is also sufficient to shift AMPARs
   to the surface and rescue spine recovery in a GRIP1 dominant-negative
   background. Thus, our results unravel a crucial role for ephrinB2 during
   homeostatic plasticity and identify a potential pharmacological target
   to improve dendritic spine plasticity upon injury.},

Abstract = {Cell-free (CF) expression technologies have emerged as promising methods
   for the production of individual membrane proteins of different types
   and origin. However, many membrane proteins need to be integrated in
   complex assemblies by interaction with soluble and membrane-integrated
   subunits in order to adopt stable and functionally folded structures.
   The production of complete molecular machines by CF expression as
   advancement of the production of only individual subunits would open a
   variety of new possibilities to study their assembly mechanisms,
   function, or composition. We demonstrate the successful CF formation of
   large molecular complexes consisting of both membrane-integrated and
   soluble subunits by expression of the atp operon from Caldalkalibacillus
   thermarum strain TA2.A1 using Escherichia coli extracts. The operon
   comprises nine open reading frames, and the 542-kDa F1Fo-ATP synthase
   complex is composed of 9 soluble and 16 membrane-embedded proteins in
   the stoichiometry alpha(3)beta(3)gamma delta epsilon ab(2)c(13).
   Complete assembly into the functional complex was accomplished in all
   three typically used CF expression modes by (i) solubilizing initial
   precipitates, (ii) cotranslational insertion into detergent micelles or
   (iii) cotranslational insertion into preformed liposomes. The presence
   of all eight subunits, as well as specific enzyme activity and
   inhibition of the complex, was confirmed by biochemical analyses,
   freeze-fracture electron microscopy, and immunogold labeling. Further,
   single-particle analysis demonstrates that the structure and subunit
   organization of the CF and the reference in vivo expressed ATP synthase
   complexes are identical. This work establishes the production of highly
   complex molecular machines in defined environments either as
   proteomicelles or as proteoliposomes as a new application of CF
   expression systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The spatial organization of transmembrane receptors is a critical step
   in signal transduction and receptor trafficking in cells. Transmembrane
   receptors engage in lateral homotypic and heterotypic cis-interactions
   as well as intercellular trans-interactions that result in the formation
   of signalling foci for the initiation of different signalling networks.
   Several aspects of ligand-induced receptor clustering and association
   with signalling proteins are also influenced by the lipid composition of
   membranes. Thus, lipid microdomains have a function in tuning the
   activity of many transmembrane receptors by positively or negatively
   affecting receptor clustering and signal transduction. We review the
   current knowledge about the functions of clustering of transmembrane
   receptors and lipid-protein interactions important for the spatial
   organization of signalling at the membrane. The EMBO Journal (2010) 29,

Abstract = {The large membrane protein complexes of mitochondrial oxidative
   phosphorylation are composed of central subunits that are essential for
   their bioenergetic core function and accessory subunits that may assist
   in regulation, assembly or stabilization. Although sequence conservation
   is low, a significant proportion of the accessory subunits is
   characterized by a common single transmembrane (STMD) topology. The STMD
   signature is also found in subunits of other membrane protein complexes.
   We hypothesize that the general function of STMD subunits is to organize
   the hydrophobic subunits of large membrane protein complexes in
   specialized environments like the inner mitochondrial membrane. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Accurate labeling of endogenous proteins for advanced light microscopy
   in living cells remains challenging. Nanobodies have been widely used
   for antigen labeling, visualization of subcellular protein localization
   and interactions. To facilitate an expanded application, we present a
   scalable and high-throughput strategy to simultaneously target multiple
   endogenous proteins in living cells with micro- to nanometer resolution.
   For intracellular protein labeling, we advanced nanobodies by
   site-specific and stoichiometric attachment of bright organic
   fluorophores. Their fast and fine-tuned intracellular transfer by
   microfluidic cell squeezing enabled high-throughput delivery with less
   than 10\% dead cells. This strategy allowed for the dual-color imaging
   of distinct endogenous cellular structures, and culminated in
   super-resolution imaging of native protein networks in genetically
   non-modified living cells. The simultaneous delivery of multiple
   engineered nanobodies does not only offer exciting prospects for
   multiplexed imaging of endogenous protein, but also holds potential for
   visualizing native cellular structures with unprecedented accuracy.},

Abstract = {The essential ATP-binding cassette protein ABCE1 splits 80S ribosomes
   into 60S and 40S subunits after canonical termination or
   quality-control-based mRNA surveillance processes. However, the
   underlying splitting mechanism remains enigmatic. Here, we present a
   cryo-EM structure of the yeast 40S-ABCE1 post-splitting complex at
   3.9-angstrom resolution. Compared to the pre-splitting state, we observe
   repositioning of ABCE1's iron-sulfur cluster domain, which rotates 150
   degrees into a binding pocket on the 40S subunit. This repositioning
   explains a newly observed anti-association activity of ABCE1. Notably,
   the movement implies a collision with A-site factors, thus explaining
   the splitting mechanism. Disruption of key interactions in the
   post-splitting complex impairs cellular homeostasis. Additionally, the
   structure of a native post-splitting complex reveals ABCE1 to be part of
   the 43S initiation complex, suggesting a coordination of termination,
   recycling, and initiation.},

Abstract = {The mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACPM/NDUFAB1) is a central
   element of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis type II machinery.
   Originally ACPM was detected as a subunit of respiratory complex I but
   the reason for the association with the large enzyme complex remained
   elusive. Complex I from the aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica comprises
   two different ACPMs, ACPM1 and ACPM2. They are anchored to the protein
   complex by LYR (leucine-tyrosine-arginine) motif containing protein
   (LYRM) subunits LYRM3 (NDUFB9) and LYRM6 (NDUFA6). The ACPM1-LYRM6 and
   ACPM2-LYRM3 modules are essential for complex I activity and
   assembly/stability, respectively. We show that in addition to the
   complex I bound fraction, ACPM1 is present as a free matrix protein and
   in complex with the soluble LYRM4(ISD11)/NFS1 complex implicated in Fe-S
   cluster biogenesis. We show that the presence of a long acyl chain bound
   to the phosphopantetheine cofactor is important for docking ACPMs to
   protein complexes and we propose that association of ACPMs and LYRMs is
   universally based on a new protein-protein interaction motif.},

Title = {Identifying and quantifying two ligand-binding sites while imaging
   native human membrane receptors by AFM},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A current challenge in life sciences is to image cell membrane receptors
   while characterizing their specific interactions with various ligands.
   Addressing this issue has been hampered by the lack of suitable
   nanoscopic methods. Here we address this challenge and introduce
   multifunctional high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) to image
   human protease-activated receptors (PAR1) in the functionally important
   lipid membrane and to simultaneously localize and quantify their binding
   to two different ligands. Therefore, we introduce the surface chemistry
   to bifunctionalize AFM tips with the native receptor-activating peptide
   and a tris-N-nitrilotriacetic acid (tris-NTA) group binding to a
   His10-tag engineered to PAR1. We further introduce ways to discern
   between the binding of both ligands to different receptor sites while
   imaging native PAR1s. Surface chemistry and nanoscopic method are
   applicable to a range of biological systems in vitro and in vivo and to
   concurrently detect and localize multiple ligand-binding sites at single
   receptor resolution.},

Title = {LRPPRC is necessary for polyadenylation and coordination of translation

Journal = {EMBO JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Regulation of mtDNA expression is critical for maintaining cellular
   energy homeostasis and may, in principle, occur at many different
   levels. The leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing (LRPPRC)
   protein regulates mitochondrial mRNA stability and an amino-acid
   substitution of this protein causes the French-Canadian type of Leigh
   syndrome (LSFC), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by complex
   IV deficiency. We have generated conditional Lrpprc knockout mice and
   show here that the gene is essential for embryonic development.
   Tissue-specific disruption of Lrpprc in heart causes mitochondrial
   cardiomyopathy with drastic reduction in steady-state levels of most
   mitochondrial mRNAs. LRPPRC forms an RNA-dependent protein complex that
   is necessary for maintaining a pool of non-translated mRNAs in mammalian
   mitochondria. Loss of LRPPRC does not only decrease mRNA stability, but
   also leads to loss of mRNA polyadenylation and the appearance of
   aberrant mitochondrial translation. The translation pattern without the
   presence of LRPPRC is misregulated with excessive translation of some
   transcripts and no translation of others. Our findings point to the
   existence of an elaborate machinery that regulates mammalian mtDNA
   expression at the post-transcriptional level. The EMBO Journal (2012)

Abstract = {We describe herein a platform to study protein-protein interactions and
   to form functional protein complexes in nanoscopic surface domains. For
   this purpose, we employed multivalent chelator (MCh) templates, which
   were fabricated in a stepwise procedure combining dip-pen
   nanolithography (DPN) and molecular recognition-directed assembly.
   First, we demonstrated that an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip inked
   with an oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) disulfide compound bearing terminal
   biotin groups can be used to generate biotin patterns on gold achieving
   line widths below 100 nm, a generic platform for fabrication of
   functional nanostructures via the highly specific biotin-streptavidin
   recognition. Subsequently, we converted such biotin/streptavidin
   patterns into functional MCh patterns for reversible assembly of
   histidine-tagged (His-tagged) proteins via the attachment of a
   tris-nitriloacetic acid (trisNTA) biotin derivative. Fluorescence
   microscopy confirmed reversible immobilization of the receptor subunit
   ifnar2-His(10) and its interaction with interferon-alpha 2 labeled with
   fluorescent quantum dots in a 7 x 7 dot array consisting of trisNTA
   spots with a diameter of similar to 230 nm. Moreover, we carried out
   characterization of the specificity, stability, and reversibility as
   well as quantitative real-time analysis of protein-protein interactions
   at the fabricated nanopatterns by imaging surface plasmon resonance. Our
   work offers a route for construction and analysis of functional
   protein-based nanoarchitectures.},

Title = {Functional Detection of Proteins by Caged Aptamers},

Abstract = {While many diagnostic assay platforms enable the measurement of analytes
   with high sensitivity, most of them result in a disruption of the
   analyte's native structure and, thus, in loss of function. Consequently,
   the analyte can be used neither for further analytical assessment nor
   functional analysis. Herein we report the use of caged aptamers as
   templates during apta-PCR analysis of targets. Aptamers are short
   nucleic acids that fold into a well-defined three-dimensional structure
   in which they interact with target molecules with high affinity and
   specificity. Nucleic acid aptamers can also serve as templates for qPCR
   approaches and, thus, have been used as high affinity ligands to bind to
   target molecules and subsequently for quantification by qPCR, an assay
   format coined apta-PCR. Caged aptamers in turn refer to variants that
   bear one or more photolabile groups at strategic positions. The activity
   of caged aptamers can thus be turned on or off by light irradiation. The
   latter allows the mild elution of target-bound aptamers while the
   target's native structure and function remain intact. We demonstrate
   that this approach allows the quantitative and subsequently the
   functional assessment of analytes. Since caged aptamers can be generated
   emanating from virtually every available aptamer, the described approach
   can be generalized and adopted to any target-aptamer pair and, thus,
   have a broad applicability in proteomics and clinical diagnostics.},

Abstract = {Regulation of cargo transport via adaptor molecules is essential for
   neuronal development. However, the role of PDZ scaffolding proteins as
   adaptors in neuronal cargo trafficking is still poorly understood. Here,
   we show by genetic deletion in mice that the multi-PDZ domain
   scaffolding protein glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) is
   required for dendrite development. We identify an interaction between
   GRIP1 and 14-3-3 proteins that is essential for the function of GRIP1 as
   an adaptor protein in dendritic cargo transport. Mechanistically, 14-3-3
   binds to the kinesin-1 binding region in GRIP1 in a phospho-dependent
   manner and detaches GRIP1 from the kinesin-1 motor protein complex
   thereby regulating cargo transport. A single point mutation in the
   Thr956 of GRIP1 in transgenic mice impairs dendritic development.
   Together, our results show a regulatory role for GRIP1 during
   microtubule-based transport and suggest a crucial function for 14-3-3
   proteins in controlling kinesin-1 motor attachment during neuronal
   development.},

Abstract = {Biogenesis of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) relies on a large
   number of assembly factors, among them the transmembrane protein Surf1.
   The loss of human Surf1 function is associated with Leigh syndrome, a
   fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by severe COX deficiency. In the
   bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans, two homologous proteins, Surf1c and
   Surf1q, were identified, which we characterize in the present study.
   When coexpressed in Escherichia coli together with enzymes for heme a
   synthesis, the bacterial Surf1 proteins bind heme a in vivo. Using redox
   difference spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry, the
   binding of the heme cofactor to purified apo-Surf1c and apo-Surf1q is
   quantified: Each of the Paracoccus proteins binds heme a in a 1:1
   stoichiometry and with K-d values in the submicromolar range. In
   addition, we identify a conserved histidine as a residue crucial for
   heme binding. Contrary to most earlier concepts, these data support a
   direct role of Surf1 in heme a cofactor insertion into COX subunit I by
   providing a protein-bound heme a pool.},

Abstract = {The photostability of fluorescent labels comprises one of the main
   limitations in single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) and super-resolution
   imaging. An attractive strategy to increase the photostability of
   organic fluorophores relies on their coupling to photostabilizers, e.g.,
   triplet excited state quenchers, rendering self-healing dyes. Herein we
   report the self-healing properties of trisNTA-Alexa647 fluorophores
   (NTA, N-nitrilotriacetic acid). Primarily designed to specifically label
   biomolecules containing an oligohistidine tag, we hypothesized that the
   increased effective concentration of Ni(II) triplet state quenchers
   would lead to their improved photostability. We evaluated photon output,
   survival time, and photon count rate of different Alexa647-labeled
   trisNTA constructs differing in the length and rigidity of the
   fluorophore-trisNTA linker. Maximum photon output enhancements of
   25-fold versus Alexa647-DNA were recorded for a short tetraproline
   linker, superseding the solution based photostabilization by Ni(II).
   Steady-state and time-resolved studies illustrate that trisNTA
   self-healing role is associated with a dynamic excited triplet state
   quenching by Ni(II). Here improved photophysical/photochemical
   properties require for a judicious choice of linker length and rigidity,
   and in turn a balance between rapid dynamic triplet excited state
   quenching versus dynamic/static singlet excited state quenching. TrisNTA
   fluorophores offer superior properties for SMF allowing specific
   labeling and increased photostability, making them ideal candidates for
   extended single-molecule imaging techniques.},

Title = {EphrinB2 repression through ZEB2 mediates tumour invasion and
   anti-angiogenic resistance},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Diffuse invasion of the surrounding brain parenchyma is a major obstacle
   in the treatment of gliomas with various therapeutics, including
   anti-angiogenic agents. Here we identify the epi-/genetic and
   microenvironmental downregulation of ephrinB2 as a crucial step that
   promotes tumour invasion by abrogation of repulsive signals. We
   demonstrate that ephrinB2 is downregulated in human gliomas as a
   consequence of promoter hypermethylation and gene deletion.
   Consistently, genetic deletion of ephrinB2 in a murine high-grade glioma
   model increases invasion. Importantly, ephrinB2 gene silencing is
   complemented by a hypoxia-induced transcriptional repression.
   Mechanistically, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha induces the EMT
   repressor ZEB2, which directly downregulates ephrinB2 through promoter
   binding to enhance tumour invasiveness. This mechanism is activated
   following anti-angiogenic treatment of gliomas and is efficiently
   blocked by disrupting ZEB2 activity. Taken together, our results
   identify ZEB2 as an attractive therapeutic target to inhibit tumour
   invasion and counteract tumour resistance mechanisms induced by
   anti-angiogenic treatment strategies.},

Abstract = {Super-resolution fluorescence imaging by photoactivation or
   photoswitching of single fluorophores and position determination
   (single-molecule localization microscopy, SMLM) provides microscopic
   images with subdiffraction spatial resolution. This technology has
   enabled new insights into how proteins are organized in a cellular
   context, with a spatial resolution approaching virtually the molecular
   level. A unique strength of SMLM is that it delivers molecule-resolved
   information, along with super-resolved images of cellular structures.
   This allows quantitative access to cellular structures, for example, how
   proteins are distributed and organized and how they interact with other
   biomolecules. Ultimately, it is even possible to determine protein
   numbers in cells and the number of subunits in a protein complex. SMLM
   thus has the potential to pave the way toward a better understanding of
   how cells function at the molecular level. In this review, we describe
   how SMLM has contributed new knowledge in eukaryotic biology, and we
   specifically focus on quantitative biological data extracted from SMLM
   images.},

Abstract = {Ligand-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) activation
   controls nuclear factor.-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
   (NF-kappa B) signaling, cell proliferation, programmed cell death, and
   survival and is crucially involved in inflammation, autoimmune
   disorders, and cancer progression. Despite the relevance of TNFR1
   clustering for signaling, oligomerization of ligand-free and
   ligand-activated TNFR1 remains controversial. At present, models range
   from ligand-independent receptor predimerization to ligand-induced
   oligomerization. Here, we used quantitative, single-molecule
   superresolution microscopy to study TNFR1 assembly directly in native
   cellular settings and at physiological cell surface abundance. In the
   absence of its ligand TNF alpha, TNFR1 assembled into monomeric and
   dimeric receptor units. Upon binding of TNF alpha, TNFR1 clustered
   predominantly not only into trimers but also into higher-order
   oligomers. A functional mutation in the preligand assembly domain of
   TNFR1 resulted in only monomeric TNFR1, which exhibited impaired ligand
   binding. In contrast, a form of TNFR1 with a mutation in the
   ligand-binding CRD2 subdomain retained the monomer-to-dimer ratio of the
   unliganded wild-type TNFR1 but exhibited no ligand binding. These
   results underscore the importance of ligand-independent TNFR1
   dimerization in NF-kappa B signaling.},

Abstract = {In Arabidopsis, lateral root primordia (LRPs) originate from pericycle
   cells located deep within the parental root and have to emerge through
   endodermal, cortical, and epidermal tissues. These overlaying tissues
   place biomechanical constraints on the LRPs that are likely to impact
   their morphogenesis. This study probes the interplay between the
   patterns of cell division, organ shape, and overlaying tissues on LRP
   morphogenesis by exploiting recent advances in live plant cell imaging
   and image analysis. Our 3D/4D image analysis revealed that early stage
   LRPs exhibit tangential divisions that create a ring of cells corralling
   a population of rapidly dividing cells at its center. The patterns of
   division in the latter population of cells during LRP morphogenesis are
   not stereotypical. In contrast, statistical analysis demonstrated that
   the shape of new LRPs is highly conserved. We tested the relative
   importance of cell division pattern versus overlaying tissues on LRP
   morphogenesis using mutant and transgenic approaches. The double mutant
   aurora1 (aur1) aur2 disrupts the pattern of LRP cell divisions and
   impacts its growth dynamics, yet the new organ's dome shape remains
   normal. In contrast, manipulating the properties of overlaying tissues
   disrupted LRP morphogenesis. We conclude that the interaction with
   overlaying tissues, rather than the precise pattern of divisions, is
   most important for LRP morphogenesis and optimizes the process of
   lateral root emergence.},

Abstract = {Light-sheet-based fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) features optical
   sectioning in the excitation process. It minimizes fluorophore bleaching
   as well as phototoxic effects and provides a true axial resolution. The
   detection path resembles properties of conventional fluorescence
   microscopy. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is attractive for
   superresolution because of its moderate excitation intensity, high
   acquisition speed, and compatibility with all fluorophores. We introduce
   SIM to LSFM because the combination pushes the lateral resolution to the
   physical limit of linear SIM. The instrument requires three objective
   lenses and relies on methods to control two counterpropagating coherent
   light sheets that generate excitation patterns in the focal plane of the
   detection lens. SIM patterns with the finest line spacing in the far
   field become available along multiple orientations. Flexible control of
   rotation, frequency, and phase shift of the perfectly modulated light
   sheet are demonstrated. Images of beads prove a near-isotropic lateral
   resolution of sub-100 nm. Images of yeast endoplasmic reticulum show
   that coherent structured illumination (csi) LSFMperforms with
   physiologically relevant specimens.},

Abstract = {The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) is
   a conserved multi-subunit complex crucial for maintaining the
   characteristic architecture of mitochondria. Studies with deletion
   mutants identified Mic10 and Mic60 as core sub-units of MICOS. Mic60 has
   been studied in detail; however, topogenesis and function of Mic10 are
   unknown. We report that targeting of Mic10 to the mitochondrial inner
   membrane requires a positively charged internal loop, but no cleavable
   presequence. Both transmembrane segments of Mic10 carry a characteristic
   four-glycine motif, which has been found in the ring-forming rotor
   subunit of F1Fo-ATP synthases. Overexpression of Mic10 profoundly alters
   the architecture of the inner membrane independently of other MICOS
   components. The four-glycine motifs are dispensable for interaction of
   Mic10 with other MICOS subunits but are crucial for the formation of
   large Mic10 oligomers. Our studies identify a unique role of Mic10
   oligomers in promoting the formation of inner membrane crista junctions.},

Title = {Locking loop movement in the ubiquinone pocket of complex I disengages
   the proton pumps},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {Complex I (proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the largest
   enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and a significant source
   of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesized that during energy
   conversion by complex I, electron transfer onto ubiquinone triggers the
   concerted rearrangement of three protein loops of subunits ND1, ND3, and
   49-kDa thereby generating the power-stoke driving proton pumping. Here
   we show that fixing loop TMH1-2(ND3) to the nearby subunit PSST via a
   disulfide bridge introduced by site-directed mutagenesis reversibly
   disengages proton pumping without impairing ubiquinone reduction,
   inhibitor binding or the Active/Deactive transition. The X-ray structure
   of mutant complex I indicates that the disulfide bridge immobilizes but
   does not displace the tip of loop TMH1-2(ND)(3). We conclude that
   movement of loop TMH1-2(ND)(3) located at the ubiquinone-binding pocket
   is required to drive proton pumping corroborating one of the central
   predictions of our model for the mechanism of energy conversion by
   complex I proposed earlier.},

Abstract = {Latrophilins, receptors for spider venom alpha-latrotoxin, are adhesion
   type G-protein-coupled receptors with emerging functions in synapse
   development. The N-terminal region binds the endogenous cell adhesion
   molecule FLRT, a major regulator of cortical and synapse development. We
   present crystallographic data for the mouse Latrophilin3 lectin and
   olfactomedin-like (Olf) domains, thereby revealing the Olf
   beta-propeller fold and conserved calcium-binding site. We locate the
   FLRT-Latrophilin binding surfaces by a combination of sequence
   conservation analysis, point mutagenesis, and surface plasmon resonance
   experiments. In stripe assays, we show that wild-type Latrophilin3 and
   its high-affinity interactor FLRT2, but not the binding-impaired mutants
   we generated, promote HeLa cell adhesion. In contrast, cortical neurons
   expressing endogenous FLRTs are repelled by wild-type Latrophilin3 and
   not by the binding-impaired mutant. Taken together, we present molecular
   level insights into Latrophilin structure, its FLRT-binding mechanism,
   and a role for Latrophilin and FLRT that goes beyond a simply adhesive
   interaction.},

Abstract = {The biogenesis of human cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is an intricate
   process in which three mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA)-encoded core subunits
   are assembled in a coordinated way with at least 11 nucleus-encoded
   subunits. Many chaperones shared between yeast and humans are involved
   in COX assembly. Here, we have used a MT-CO3 mutant cybrid cell line to
   define the composition of assembly intermediates and identify new human
   COX assembly factors. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis led us to
   modify the assembly model from a sequential pathway to a module-based
   process. Each module contains one of the three core subunits, together
   with different ancillary components, including HIGD1A. By the same
   analysis, we identified the short isoform of the myofibrillogenesis
   regulator 1(MR-1S) as a new COX assembly factor, which works with the
   highly conserved PET100 and PET117 chaperones to assist COX biogenesis
   in higher eukaryotes.},

   essential for both developmental and pathological angiogenesis(1).
   Notch-1 signalling regulates the generation of tip cells, which respond
   to gradients of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A)(2). The
   molecular cues and signalling pathways that control the guidance of tip
   cells are poorly understood. Bidirectional signalling by Eph receptors
   and ephrin ligands represents one of the most important guidance cues
   involved in axon path finding(3). Here we show that ephrin-B2 reverse
   signalling involving PDZ interactions regulates endothelial tip cell
   guidance to control angiogenic sprouting and branching in physiological
   and pathological angiogenesis. In vivo, ephrin-B2
   PDZ-signalling-deficient mice (ephrin-B2DV) exhibit a reduced number of
   tip cells with fewer filopodial extensions at the vascular front in the
   mouse retina. In pathological settings, impaired PDZ signalling
   decreases tumour vascularization and growth. Mechanistically, we show
   that ephrin-B2 controls VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 internalization and
   signalling. Importantly, internalization of VEGFR2 is necessary for
   activation and downstream signalling of the receptor and is required for
   VEGF-induced tip cell filopodial extension. Together, our results
   suggest that ephrin-B2 at the tip cell filopodia regulates the proper
   spatial activation of VEGFR2 endocytosis and signalling to direct
   filopodial extension. Blocking ephrin-B2 reverse signalling may be an
   attractive alternative or combinatorial anti-angiogenic therapy strategy
   to disrupt VEGFR2 function in tumour angiogenesis.},

Abstract = {While overall hydrophobicity is generally recognized as the main
   characteristic of transmembrane (TM) alpha-helices, the only membrane
   system for which there are detailed quantitative data on how different
   amino acids contribute to the overall efficiency of membrane insertion
   is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. Here, we provide
   comparable data for TIM23-mediated membrane protein insertion into the
   inner mitochondrial membrane of yeast cells. We find that hydrophobicity
   and the location of polar and aromatic residues are strong determinants
   of membrane insertion. These results parallel what has been found
   previously for the ER. However, we see striking differences between the
   effects elicited by charged residues flanking the TM segments when
   comparing the mitochondrial inner membrane and the ER, pointing to an
   unanticipated difference between the two insertion systems. The EMBO

Abstract = {We have analyzed the relaxation properties of all P-31 nuclei in an RNA
   cUUCGg tetraloop model hairpin at proton magnetic field strengths of
   300, 600 and 900 MHz in solution. Significant H, P dipolar contributions
   to R (1) and R (2) relaxation are observed in a protonated RNA sample at
   600 MHz. These contributions can be suppressed using a perdeuterated RNA
   sample. In order to interpret the P-31 relaxation data (R (1), R (2)),
   we measured the P-31 chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) by solid-state NMR
   spectroscopy under various salt and hydration conditions. A value of
   178.5 ppm for the P-31 CSA in the static state (S (2) = 1) could be
   determined. In order to obtain information about fast time scale
   dynamics we performed a modelfree analysis on the basis of our
   relaxation data. The results show that subnanosecond dynamics detected
   around the phosphodiester backbone are more pronounced than the dynamics
   detected for the ribofuranosyl and nucleobase moieties of the individual
   nucleotides (Duchardt and Schwalbe, J Biomol NMR 32:295-308, 2005;
   Ferner et al., Nucleic Acids Res 36:1928-1940, 2008). Furthermore, the
   dynamics of the individual phosphate groups seem to be correlated to the
   5' neighbouring nucleobases.},

Abstract = {Specific protein-lipid interactions have been identified in X-ray
   structures of membrane proteins. The role of specifically bound lipid
   molecules in protein function remains elusive. In the current study, we
   investigated how phospholipids influence catalytic, spectral and
   electrochemical properties of the yeast respiratory cytochrome bc(1)
   complex and how disruption of a specific cardiolipin binding site in
   cytochrome c(1) alters respiratory supercomplex formation in
   mitochondrial membranes. Purified yeast cytochrome bc(1) complex was
   treated with phospholipase A(2). The lipid-depleted enzyme was stable
   but nearly catalytically inactive. The absorption maxima of the reduced
   b-hemes were blue-shifted. The midpoint potentials of the b-hemes of the
   delipidated complex were shifted from -52 to -82 mV (heme b(L)) and from
   +113 to -2 mV (heme b(H)). These alterations could be reversed by
   reconstitution of the delipidated enzyme with a mixture of asolectin and
   cardiolipin, whereas addition of the single components could not reverse
   the alterations. We further analyzed the role of a specific cardiolipin
   binding site (CL1) in supercomplex formation by site-directed
   mutagenesis and BN-PAGE. The results suggested that cardiolipin
   stabilizes respiratory supercomplex formation by neutralizing the
   charges of lysine residues in the vicinity of the presumed interaction
   domain between cytochrome bc(1) complex and cytochrome c oxidase.
   Overall, the study supports the idea, that enzyme-bound phospholipids
   can play an important role in the regulation of protein function and
   protein-protein interaction. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {EMBO REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process through which
   defective or otherwise harmful cellular components are targeted for
   degradation via the lysosomal route. Regulatory pathways, involving
   post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, play a
   critical role in controlling this tightly orchestrated process. Here, we
   demonstrate that TBK1 regulates autophagy by phosphorylating autophagy
   modifiers LC3C and GABARAP-L2 on surface-exposed serine residues (LC3C
   S93 and S96; GABARAP-L2 S87 and S88). This phosphorylation event impedes
   their binding to the processing enzyme ATG4 by destabilizing the
   complex. Phosphorylated LC3C/GABARAP-L2 cannot be removed from liposomes
   by ATG4 and are thus protected from ATG4-mediated premature removal from
   nascent autophagosomes. This ensures a steady coat of lipidated
   LC3C/GABARAP-L2 throughout the early steps in autophagosome formation
   and aids in maintaining a unidirectional flow of the autophagosome to
   the lysosome. Taken together, we present a new regulatory mechanism of
   autophagy, which influences the conjugation and de-conjugation of LC3C
   and GABARAP-L2 to autophagosomes by TBK1-mediated phosphorylation.},

Abstract = {The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter MsbA is an ATP-driven lipid-A
   flippase. It belongs to the ABC protein superfamily whose members are
   characterized by conserved motifs in their nucleotide binding domains
   (NBDs), which are responsible for ATP hydrolysis. Recently, it was found
   that MsbA could catalyze a reverse adenylate kinase (rAK)-like reaction
   in addition to ATP hydrolysis. Both reactions are connected and mediated
   by the same conserved NBD domains. Here, the structural foundations
   underlying the nucleotide binding to MsbA were therefore explored using
   a concerted approach based on conventional- and DNP-enhanced solid-state
   NMR, pulsed-EPR, and MD simulations. MsbA reconstituted into lipid
   bilayers was trapped in various catalytic states corresponding to
   intermediates of the coupled ATPase-rAK mechanism. The analysis of
   nucleotide-binding dependent chemical shift changes, and the detection
   of through-space contacts between bound nucleotides and MsbA within
   these states provides evidence for an additional nucleotide-binding site
   in close proximity to the Q-loop and the His-Switch. By replacing Mg2+
   with Mn2+ and employing pulsed EPR spectroscopy, evidence is provided
   that this newly found nucleotide binding site does not interfere with
   the coordination of the required metal ion. Molecular dynamic (MD)
   simulations of nucleotide and metal binding required for the coupled
   ATPase-rAK mechanism have been used to corroborate these experimental
   findings and provide additional insight into nucleotide location,
   orientation, and possible binding modes.},

Abstract = {Recently, mutations in the mitochondrial translation optimization factor
   1 gene (MTO1) were identified as causative in children with hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis and respiratory chain defect. Here, we
   describe an MTO1-deficient mouse model generated by gene trap
   mutagenesis that mirrors the human phenotype remarkably well. As in
   patients, the most prominent signs and symptoms were cardiovascular and
   included bradycardia and cardiomyopathy. In addition, the mutant mice
   showed a marked worsening of arrhythmias during induction and reversal
   of anaesthesia. The detailed morphological and biochemical workup of
   murine hearts indicated that the myocardial damage was due to complex I
   deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, neurological
   examination was largely normal in Mto1-deficient mice. A translational
   consequence of this mouse model may be to caution against
   anaesthesia-related cardiac arrhythmias which may be fatal in patients.},

Title = {Loss of PHD3 allows tumours to overcome hypoxic growth inhibition and
   sustain proliferation through EGFR},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Solid tumours are exposed to microenvironmental factors such as hypoxia
   that normally inhibit cell growth. However, tumour cells are capable of
   counteracting these signals through mechanisms that are largely unknown.
   Here we show that the prolyl hydroxylase PHD3 restrains tumour growth in
   response to microenvironmental cues through the control of EGFR. PHD3
   silencing in human gliomas or genetic deletion in a murine high-grade
   astrocytoma model markedly promotes tumour growth and the ability of
   tumours to continue growing under unfavourable conditions. The
   growth-suppressive function of PHD3 is independent of the established
   PHD3 targets HIF and NF-kappa B and its hydroxylase activity. Instead,
   loss of PHD3 results in hyperphosphorylation of epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR). Importantly, epigenetic/genetic silencing of PHD3
   preferentially occurs in gliomas without EGFR amplification. Our
   findings reveal that PHD3 inactivation provides an alternative route of
   EGFR activation through which tumour cells sustain proliferative
   signalling even under conditions of limited oxygen availability.},

Title = {Life times of metastable states guide regulatory signaling in
   transcriptional riboswitches},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Transcriptional riboswitches modulate downstream gene expression by a
   tight coupling of ligand-dependent RNA folding kinetics with the rate of
   transcription. RNA folding pathways leading to functional ON and OFF
   regulation involve the formation of metastable states within
   well-defined sequence intervals during transcription. The kinetic
   requirements for the formation and preservation of these metastable
   states in the context of transcription remain unresolved. Here, we
   reversibly trap the previously defined regulatory relevant metastable
   intermediate of the Mesoplasma florum 2'-deoxyguanosine (2' dG)-sensing
   riboswitch using a photocaging-ligation approach, and monitor folding to
   its native state by real-time NMR in both presence and absence of
   ligand. We further determine transcription rates for two different
   bacterial RNA polymerases. Our results reveal that the riboswitch
   functions only at transcription rates typical for bacterial polymerases
   (10-50 nt s(-1)) and that gene expression is modulated by 40-50\% only,
   while subtle differences in folding rates guide population ratios within
   the structural ensemble to a specific regulatory outcome.},

Title = {Virtual-'Light-Sheet' Single-Molecule Localisation Microscopy Enables
   Quantitative Optical Sectioning for Super-Resolution Imaging},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {Single-molecule super-resolution microscopy allows imaging of
   fluorescently-tagged proteins in live cells with a precision well below
   that of the diffraction limit. Here, we demonstrate 3D sectioning with
   single-molecule super-resolution microscopy by making use of the fitting
   information that is usually discarded to reject fluorophores that emit
   from above or below a virtual-'light-sheet', a thin volume centred on
   the focal plane of the microscope. We describe an easy-to-use routine
   (implemented as an open-source ImageJ plug-in) to quickly analyse a
   calibration sample to define and use such a virtual light-sheet. In
   addition, the plug-in is easily usable on almost any existing 2D
   super-resolution instrumentation. This optical sectioning of
   super-resolution images is achieved by applying well-characterised width
   and amplitude thresholds to diffraction-limited spots that can be used
   to tune the thickness of the virtual light-sheet. This allows
   qualitative and quantitative imaging improvements: by rejecting
   out-of-focus fluorophores, the super-resolution image gains contrast and
   local features may be revealed; by retaining only fluorophores close to
   the focal plane, virtual-'light-sheet' single-molecule localisation
   microscopy improves the probability that all emitting fluorophores will
   be detected, fitted and quantitatively evaluated.},

Abstract = {Arabidopsis lateral root radial emergence is spatially constrained by
   the dual xylem poles in the main root. However, the asymmetric presence
   of water can modify the orientation of lateral roots at a very early
   stage.
   Root branching is influenced by the soil environment and exhibits a high
   level of plasticity. We report that the radial positioning of emerging
   lateral roots is influenced by their hydrological environment during
   early developmental stages. New lateral root primordia have both a high
   degree of flexibility in terms of initiation and development angle
   towards the available water. Our observations reveal how the external
   hydrological environment regulates lateral root morphogenesis.},

Title = {NTPDase2 and Purinergic Signaling Control Progenitor Cell Proliferation
   in Neurogenic Niches of the Adult Mouse Brain},
Journal = {STEM CELLS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {253-264},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Nerve cells are continuously generated from stem cells in the adult
   mammalian subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampal dentate gyrus. We
   have previously noted that stem/progenitor cells in the SVZ and the
   subgranular layer (SGL) of the dentate gyrus express high levels of
   plasma membrane-bound nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2
   (NTPDase2), an ectoenzyme that hydrolyzes extracellular nucleoside
   diphosphates and triphosphates. We inferred that deletion of NTPDase2
   would increase local extracellular nucleoside triphosphate
   concentrations perturbing purinergic signaling and boosting progenitor
   cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Using newly generated mice globally
   null for Entpd2, we demonstrate that NTPDase2 is the major
   ectonucleotidase in these progenitor cell-rich areas. Using
   BrdU-labeling protocols, we have measured stem cell proliferation and
   determined long-term survival of cell progeny under basal conditions.
   Brains of Entpd2 null mice revealed increased progenitor cell
   proliferation in both the SVZ and the SGL. However, this occurred
   without noteworthy alterations in long-term progeny survival. The
   hippocampal stem cell pool and the pool of the intermediate progenitor
   type-2 cells clearly expanded. However, substantive proportions of these
   proliferating cells were lost during expansion at around type-3 stage.
   Cell loss was paralleled by decreases in cAMP response element-binding
   protein phosphorylation in the doublecortin-positive progenitor cell
   population and by an increase in labeling for activated caspase-3
   levels. We propose that NTPDase2 has functionality in scavenging
   mitogenic extracellular nucleoside triphosphates in neurogenic niches of
   the adult brain, thereby acting as a homeostatic regulator of
   nucleotide-mediated neural progenitor cell proliferation and expansion.},

Abstract = {FLRTs are broadly expressed proteins with the unique property of acting
   as homophilic cell adhesion molecules and as heterophilic repulsive
   ligands of Unc5/Netrin receptors. How these functions direct cell
   behavior and the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unclear.
   Here we use X-ray crystallography to reveal the distinct structural
   bases for FLRT-mediated cell adhesion and repulsion in neurons. We apply
   this knowledge to elucidate FLRT functions during cortical development.
   We show that FLRTs regulate both the radial migration of pyramidal
   neurons, as well as their tangential spread. Mechanistically, radial
   migration is controlled by repulsive FLRT2-Unc5D interactions, while
   spatial organization in the tangential axis involves adhesive FLRT-FLRT
   interactions. Further, we show that the fundamental mechanisms of FLRT
   adhesion and repulsion are conserved between neurons and vascular
   endothelial cells. Our results reveal FLRTs as powerful guidance factors
   with structurally encoded repulsive and adhesive surfaces.},

Title = {Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Latrophilin adhesion-GPCRs (Lphn1-3 or ADGRL1-3) and Unc5 cell guidance
   receptors (Unc5A-D) interact with FLRT proteins (FLRT1-3), thereby
   promoting cell adhesion and repulsion, respectively. How the three
   proteins interact and function simultaneously is poorly understood. We
   show that Unc5D interacts with FLRT2 in cis, controlling cell adhesion
   in response to externally presented Lphn3. The ectodomains of the three
   proteins bind cooperatively. Crystal structures of the ternary complex
   formed by the extracellular domains reveal that Lphn3 dimerizes when
   bound to FLRT2:Unc5, resulting in a stoichiometry of 1:1:2
   (FLRT2:Unc5D:Lphn3). This 1:1:2 complex further dimerizes to form a
   larger `super-complex' (2:2:4), using a previously undescribed binding
   motif in the Unc5D TSP1 domain. Molecular dynamics simulations,
   point-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry demonstrate the
   stability and molecular properties of these complexes. Our data
   exemplify how receptors increase their functional repertoire by forming
   different context-dependent higher-order complexes.},

Abstract = {This review focuses on the terminal part of the respiratory chain where,
   macroscopically speaking, electron transfer (ET) switches from the
   two-electron donor, ubiquinol, to the single-electron carrier,
   cytochrome c, to finally reduce the four-electron acceptor dioxygen.
   With 3-D structures of prominent representatives of such multi-subunit
   membrane complexes known for some time, this section of the ET chain
   still leaves a number of key questions unanswered. The two relevant
   enzymes, ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase and cytochrome c oxidase,
   appear as rather diverse modules, differing largely in their design for
   substrate interaction, internal ET, and moreover, in their mechanisms of
   energy transduction. While the canonical mitochondrial complexes have
   been investigated for almost five decades, the corresponding bacterial
   enzymes have been established only recently as attractive model systems
   to address basic reactions in ET and energy transduction. Lacking the
   intricate coding background and mitochondrial assembly pathways,
   bacterial respiratory enzymes typically offer a much simpler subunit
   composition, while maintaining all fundamental functions established for
   their complex ``relatives{''}. Moreover, related issues ranging from
   primary steps in cofactor insertion to supramolecular architecture of ET
   complexes, can also be favourably addressed in prokaryotic systems to
   hone our views on prototypic structures and mechanisms common to all
   family members. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {SNCA (alpha-synuclein)-induced toxicity in yeast cells is dependent on
   sirtuin 2 (Sir2)-mediated mitophagy},
Journal = {AUTOPHAGY},

Volume = {8},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {SNCA (alpha-synuclein) misfolding and aggregation is strongly associated
   with both idiopathic and familial forms of Parkinson disease (PD).
   Evidence suggests that SNCA has an impact on cell clearance routes and
   protein quality control systems such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system
   (UPS) and autophagy. Recent advances in the key role of the autosomal
   recessive PARK2/PARKIN and PINK1 genes in mitophagy, highlighted this
   process as a prominent new pathogenic mechanism. Nevertheless, the role
   of autophagy/mitophagy in the pathogenesis of sporadic and autosomal
   dominant familial forms of PD is still enigmatic. The yeast
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful ``empty room{''} model that has
   been exploited to clarify different molecular aspects associated with
   SNCA toxicity, which combines the advantage of being an established
   system for aging research. The contribution of autophagy/mitophagy for
   the toxicity induced by the heterologous expression of the human
   wild-type SNCA gene and the clinical A53T mutant during yeast
   chronological life span (CLS) was explored. A reduced CLS together with
   an increase of autophagy and mitophagy activities were observed in cells
   expressing both forms of SNCA. Impairment of mitophagy by deletion of
   ATG11 or ATG32 resulted in a CLS extension, further implicating
   mitophagy in the SNCA toxicity. Deletion of SIR2, essential for SNCA
   toxicity, abolished autophagy and mitophagy, thereby rescuing cells.
   These data show that Sir2 functions as a regulator of autophagy, like
   its mammalian homolog, SIRT1, but also of mitophagy. Our work highlights
   that increased mitophagy activity, mediated by the regulation of ATG32
   by Sir2, is an important phenomenon linked to SNCA-induced toxicity
   during aging.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveLoss of function mutations in PINK1 typically lead to early
   onset Parkinson disease (PD). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are emerging as a
   powerful new vertebrate model to study neurodegenerative diseases. We
   used a pink1 mutant (pink(-/-)) zebrafish line with a premature stop
   mutation (Y431{*}) in the PINK1 kinase domain to identify molecular
   mechanisms leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of dopaminergic
   neurons in PINK1 deficiency.
   MethodsThe effect of PINK1 deficiency on the number of dopaminergic
   neurons, mitochondrial function, and morphology was assessed in both
   zebrafish embryos and adults. Genome-wide gene expression studies were
   undertaken to identify novel pathogenic mechanisms. Functional
   experiments were carried out to further investigate the effect of PINK1
   deficiency on early neurodevelopmental mechanisms and microglial
   activation.
   ResultsPINK1 deficiency results in loss of dopaminergic neurons as well
   as early impairment of mitochondrial function and morphology in Danio
   rerio. Expression of TigarB, the zebrafish orthologue of the human,
   TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator TIGAR, was markedly
   increased in pink(-/-) larvae. Antisense-mediated inactivation of TigarB
   gave rise to complete normalization of mitochondrial function, with
   resulting rescue of dopaminergic neurons in pink(-/-) larvae. There was
   also marked microglial activation in pink(-/-) larvae, but depletion of
   microglia failed to rescue the dopaminergic neuron loss, arguing against
   microglial activation being a key factor in the pathogenesis.
   InterpretationPink1(-/-) zebrafish are the first vertebrate model of
   PINK1 deficiency with loss of dopaminergic neurons. Our study also
   identifies TIGAR as a promising novel target for disease-modifying
   therapy in PINK1-related PD. Ann Neurol 2013;74:837-847},

   agonist-triggered GlyR currents at femto- to nanomolar and micromolar
   concentrations respectively. Here, the potentiating and inhibitory
   effects of another tropeine, 3 alpha-(3'-methoxy-benzoyloxy)nortropane
   (MBN) were examined by voltage-clamp electrophysiology at wild type and
   mutant alpha 1 GlyRs expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Several
   substitutions around the agonist-binding cavity of the alpha 1 subunit
   interface (N46C, F63A, N102A, R119K, R131A, E157C, K200A, Y202L and
   F207A) were found to reduce or eliminate MBN inhibition of glycine
   activation. In contrast, the binding site mutations Q67A, R119A and
   S129A which did not affect MBN inhibition abolished the potentiation of
   chloride currents elicited by low concentrations of the partial agonist
   taurine following pre-incubation with MBN. Thus, potentiation and
   inhibition involve distinct binding modes of MBN in the inter-subunit
   agonist-binding pocket of alpha 1 GlyRs. Homology modelling and
   molecular dynamics simulations disclosed two distinct docking modes for
   MBN, which are consistent with the differential effects of individual
   binding site substitutions on MBN inhibition and potentiation
   respectively. Together these results suggest that distinct binding modes
   at adjacent binding sites located within the agonist-binding pocket of
   the GlyR mediate the bidirectional modulatory effects of tropeines.},

Abstract = {Background: Mutations in TDP-43 are frequently found in ALS patients.
   Results: A315T TDP-43 protein is elevated from this transgenic knock-in
   allele due to disturbed feedback regulation. Conclusion: Elevation of
   A315T TDP-43 was insufficient to cause ALS in this mutant. Significance:
   This TDP-43 allele could be valuable in determining genetic or
   environmental factors that cause full-blown FTLD or ALS.
   The majority of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases as well as
   many patients suffering from frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) with
   ubiquitinated inclusion bodies show TDP-43 pathology, the protein
   encoded by the TAR DNA-binding protein (Tardbp) gene. We used
   recombinase-mediated cassette exchange to introduce an ALS patient cDNA
   into the mouse Tdp-43 locus. Expression levels of human A315T TDP-43
   protein were 300\% elevated in heterozygotes, whereas the endogenous
   mouse Tdp-43 was decreased to 20\% of wild type levels as a result of
   disturbed feedback regulation. Heterozygous TDP-43(A315TKi) mutants lost
   10\% of their body weight and developed insoluble TDP-43 protein
   starting as early as 3 months after birth, a pathology that was
   exacerbated with age. We analyzed the splicing patterns of known Tdp-43
   target genes as well as genome-wide gene expression levels in different
   tissues that indicated mitochondrial dysfunction. In heterozygous mutant
   animals, we observed a relative decrease in expression of Parkin (Park2)
   and the fatty acid transporter CD36 along with an increase in fatty
   acids, HDL cholesterol, and glucose in the blood. As seen in
   transmission electron microscopy, neuronal cells in motor cortices of
   TDP-43(A315TKi) animals had abnormal neuronal mitochondrial cristae
   formation. Motor neurons were reduced to 90\%, but only slight motoric
   impairment was detected. The observed phenotype was interpreted as a
   predisease model, which might be valuable for the identification of
   further environmental or genetic triggers of neurodegeneration.},

Abstract = {Defects of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are
   associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes and time courses.
   Combined OXPHOS deficiencies are mainly caused by mutations of nuclear
   genes that are involved in mitochondrial protein translation. Due to
   their genetic heterogeneity it is almost impossible to diagnose OXPHOS
   patients on clinical grounds alone. Hence next generation sequencing
   (NGS) provides a distinct advantage over candidate gene sequencing to
   discover the underlying genetic defect in a timely manner. One recent
   example is the identification of mutations in MTFMT that impair
   mitochondrial protein translation through decreased formylation of
   Met-tRNA(met).
   Here we report the results of a combined exome sequencing and candidate
   gene screening study. We identified nine additional MTFMT patients from
   eight families who were affected with Leigh encephalopathy or white
   matter disease, microcephaly, mental retardation, ataxia, and muscular
   hypotonia. In four patients, the causal mutations were identified by
   exome sequencing followed by stringent bioinformatic filtering. In one
   index case, exome sequencing identified a single heterozygous mutation
   leading to Sanger sequencing which identified a second mutation in the
   non-covered first exon. High-resolution melting curve-based MTFMT
   screening in 350 OXPHPOS patients identified pathogenic mutations in
   another three index cases. Mutations in one of them were not covered by
   previous exome sequencing.
   All novel mutations predict a loss-of-function or result in a severe
   decrease in MTFMT protein in patients' fibroblasts accompanied by
   reduced steady-state levels of complex I and IV subunits. Being present
   in 11 out of 13 index cases the c.626C > T mutation is one of the most
   frequent disease alleles underlying OXPHOS disorders. We provide
   detailed clinical descriptions on eleven MTFMT patients and review five
   previously reported cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {Selfish genetic elements that act as post-segregation distorters cause
   lethality in non-carrier individuals after fertilization. Two
   post-segregation distorters have been previously identified in
   Caenorhabditis elegans, the peel-1/zeel-1 and the sup-35/pha-1 elements.
   These elements seem to act as modification-rescue systems, also called
   toxin/antidote pairs. Here we show that the maternal-effect
   toxin/zygotic antidote pair sup-35/pha-1 is required for proper
   expression of apical junction (AJ) components in epithelia and that
   sup-35 toxicity increases when pathways that establish and maintain
   basal epithelial characteristics, die-1, elt-1, lin-26, and vab-10, are
   compromised. We demonstrate that pha-1(e2123) embryos, which lack the
   antidote, are defective in epidermal morphogenesis and frequently fail
   to elongate. Moreover, seam cells are frequently misshaped and
   mispositioned and cell bond tension is reduced in pha-1(e2123) embryos,
   suggesting altered tissue material properties in the epidermis. Several
   aspects of this phenotype can also be induced in wild-type embryos by
   exerting mechanical stress through uniaxial loading. Seam cell shape,
   tissue mechanics, and elongation can be restored in pha-1(e2123) embryos
   if expression of the AJ molecule DLG-1/Discs large is reduced. Thus, our
   experiments suggest that maternal-effect toxicity disrupts proper
   development of the epidermis which involves distinct transcriptional
   regulators and AJ components.},

Title = {PH-Domain-driven targeting of collybistin but not Cdc42 activation is

Abstract = {Collybistin (Cb) is a brain-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor
   (GEF) that is essential for the synaptic clustering of gephyrin and
   GABA(A) receptors in selected regions of the mammalian central nervous
   system. It has been previously proposed that Cb regulates gephyrin
   clustering by activating Cdc42, and thus acts as a signal transducer in
   a membrane activation process which labels postsynaptic membrane domains
   for inhibitory synapse formation. Here, we dissected the functional
   roles of the Dbl-homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of
   the constitutively active splice variant Cb II by substituting conserved
   amino acid residues that are required for GEF activity towards Cdc42 and
   phosphoinositide binding, respectively. A Cb II mutant lacking any
   detectable GEF activity towards Cdc42 was still fully active in inducing
   gephyrin scaffold formation, both in transfected NIH-3T3 cells and in
   cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, mice with a
   forebrain-specific inactivation of the Cdc42 gene displayed normal
   densities of gephyrin and GABA(A) receptor clusters in the hippocampus.
   In contrast, substitution of Cb II PH-domain residues essential for
   phosphoinositide binding abolished gephyrin recruitment to synaptic
   sites. Our results provide evidence that the formation of gephyrin
   scaffolds at inhibitory synapses requires an intact Cb II PH-domain but
   is Cdc42-independent.},

Abstract = {The conformational dynamics of proteins plays a key role in their
   complex physiological functions. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer
   (FRET) is a particular powerful tool for studying protein conformational
   dynamics, but requires efficient site-specific labeling with fluorescent
   reporter probes. We have employed different tris-NTA/fluorophore
   conjugates, which bind histidine-tagged proteins with high affinity, for
   site-specific incorporation of FRET acceptors into proteins, which were
   covalently labeled with a donor fluorophore. We demonstrate versatile
   application of this approach for exploring the conformation of the type
   I interferon receptor ectodomains ifnar1-EC and ifnar2-EC. Substantial
   ligand-induced conformational changes of ifnar1-EC, but not ifnar2-EC,
   were observed by monitoring the fluorescence intensity and the
   fluorescence lifetime of the FRET donor. Time-resolved fluorescence
   correlation spectroscopy revealed a substantial conformational
   flexibility of ifnar1-EC and a ligand-induced tightening. Our results
   demonstrate that protein labeling with tris-NTA/fluorophores enables for
   efficient quantitative intramolecular FRET analysis.},

Abstract = {Finding food and remaining at a food source are crucial survival
   strategies. We show how neural circuits and signaling molecules regulate
   these food-related behaviors in Caenorhabditis elegans. In the absence
   of food, AVK interneurons release FLP-1 neuropeptides that inhibit
   motorneurons to regulate body posture and velocity, thereby promoting
   dispersal. Conversely, AVK photoinhibition promoted dwelling behavior.
   We identified FLP-1 receptors required for these effects in distinct
   motoneurons. The DVA interneuron antagonizes signaling from AVK by
   releasing cholecystokinin-like neuropeptides that potentiate cholinergic
   neurons, in response to dopaminergic neurons that sense food. Dopamine
   also acts directly on AVK via an inhibitory dopamine receptor. Both AVK
   and DVA couple to head motoneurons by electrical and chemical synapses
   to orchestrate either dispersal or dwelling behavior, thus integrating
   environmental and proprioceptive signals. Dopaminergic regulation of
   food-related behavior, via similar neuropeptides, may be conserved in
   mammals.},

Title = {Head swivel on the ribosome facilitates translocation by means of

Abstract = {The elongation cycle of protein synthesis involves the delivery of
   aminoacyl-transfer RNAs to the aminoacyl-tRNA-binding site (A site) of
   the ribosome, followed by peptide-bond formation and translocation of
   the tRNAs through the ribosome to reopen the A site(1,2). The
   translocation reaction is catalysed by elongation factor G (EF-G) in a
   GTP-dependent manner(3). Despite the availability of structures of
   various EF-G-ribosome complexes, the precise mechanism by which tRNAs
   move through the ribosome still remains unclear. Here we use
   multiparticle cryoelectron microscopy analysis to resolve two previously
   unseen subpopulations within Thermus thermophilus EF-G-ribosome
   complexes at subnanometre resolution, one of them with a partly
   translocated tRNA. Comparison of these substates reveals that
   translocation of tRNA on the 30S subunit parallels the swivelling of the
   30S head and is coupled to unratcheting of the 30S body. Because the
   tRNA maintains contact with the peptidyl-tRNA-binding site (P site) on
   the 30S head and simultaneously establishes interaction with the exit
   site (E site) on the 30S platform, a novel intra-subunit `pe/E' hybrid
   state is formed. This state is stabilized by domain IV of EF-G, which
   interacts with the swivelled 30S-head conformation. These findings
   provide direct structural and mechanistic insight into the `missing
   link' in terms of tRNA intermediates involved in the universally
   conserved translocation process.},

Title = {High-resolution structure and mechanism of an F/V-hybrid rotor ring in a

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {All rotary ATPases catalyse the interconversion of ATP and ADP-P-i
   through a mechanism that is coupled to the transmembrane flow of H+ or
   Na+. Physiologically, however, F/A-type enzymes specialize in ATP
   synthesis driven by downhill ion diffusion, while eukaryotic V-type
   ATPases function as ion pumps. To begin to rationalize the molecular
   basis for this functional differentiation, we solved the crystal
   structure of the Na+-driven membrane rotor of the Acetobacterium woodii
   ATP synthase, at 2.1 angstrom resolution. Unlike known structures, this
   rotor ring is a 9: 1 heteromer of F- and V-type c-subunits and therefore
   features a hybrid configuration of ion-binding sites along its
   circumference. Molecular and kinetic simulations are used to dissect the
   mechanisms of Na+ recognition and rotation of this c-ring, and to
   explain the functional implications of the V-type c-subunit. These
   structural and mechanistic insights indicate an evolutionary path
   between synthases and pumps involving adaptations in the rotor ring.},

Abstract = {The oxazolidinones represent the first new class of antibiotics to enter
   into clinical usage within the past 30 years, but their binding site and
   mechanism of action has not been fully characterized. We have determined
   the crystal structure of the oxazolidinone linezolid bound to the
   Deinococcus radiodurans 50S ribosomal subunit. Linezolid binds in the A
   site pocket at the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome
   overlapping the aminoacyl moiety of an A-site bound tRNA as well as many
   clinically important antibiotics. Binding of linezolid stabilizes a
   distinct conformation of the universally conserved 23S rRNA nucleotide
   U2585 that would be nonproductive for peptide bond formation. In
   conjunction with available biochemical data, we present a model whereby
   oxazolidinones impart their inhibitory effect by perturbing the correct
   positioning of tRNAs on the ribosome.},

Abstract = {Respiratory complex I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is a large
   mitochondrial inner membrane enzyme consisting of 45 subunits and 8
   iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. While complex I dysfunction is the most
   common reason for mitochondrial diseases, the assembly of complex I and
   its Fe/S cofactors remains elusive. Here, we identify the human
   mitochondrial P-loop NTPase, designated huInd1, that is critically
   required for the assembly of complex I. huInd1 can bind an Fe/S cluster
   via a conserved CXXC motif in a labile fashion. Knockdown of huInd1 in
   HeLa cells by RNA interference technology led to strong decreases in
   complex I protein and activity levels, remodeling of respiratory
   supercomplexes, and alteration of mitochondrial morphology. In addition,
   huInd1 depletion resulted in massive decreases in several subunits
   (NDUFS1, NDUFV1, NDUFS3, and NDUFA13) of the peripheral arm of complex
   I, with the concomitant appearance of a 450-kDa subcomplex representing
   part of the membrane arm. By a novel radiolabeling technique, the amount
   of iron associated with complex I was also shown to reflect the
   dependence of this enzyme on huInd1 for assembly. Together, these data
   identify huInd1 as a new assembly factor for human respiratory complex I
   with a possible role in the delivery of one or more Fe/S clusters to
   complex I subunits.},

Title = {Clinical, biochemical and genetic spectrum of 70 patients with ACAD9
   deficiency: is riboflavin supplementation effective?},
Journal = {ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Background: Mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 9 (ACAD9)
   is essential for the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex
   I. Disease causing biallelic variants in ACAD9 have been reported in
   individuals presenting with lactic acidosis and cardiomyopathy.
   Results: We describe the genetic, clinical and biochemical findings in a
   cohort of 70 patients, of whom 29 previously unpublished. We found 34
   known and 18 previously unreported variants in ACAD9. No patients
   harbored biallelic loss of function mutations, indicating that this
   combination is unlikely to be compatible with life. Causal pathogenic
   variants were distributed throughout the entire gene, and there was no
   obvious genotype-phenotype correlation. Most of the patients presented
   in the first year of life. For this subgroup the survival was poor (50\%
   not surviving the first 2 years) comparing to patients with a later
   presentation (more than 90\% surviving 10 years). The most common
   clinical findings were cardiomyopathy (85\%), muscular weakness (75\%)
   and exercise intolerance (72\%). Interestingly, severe intellectual
   deficits were only reported in one patient and severe developmental
   delays in four patients. More than 70\% of the patients were able to
   perform the same activities of daily living when compared to peers.
   Conclusions: Our data show that riboflavin treatment improves complex I
   activity in the majority of patient-derived fibroblasts tested. This
   effect was also reported for most of the treated patients and is
   mirrored in the survival data. In the patient group with disease-onset
   below 1 year of age, we observed a statistically-significant better
   survival for patients treated with riboflavin.},

Abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, in
   large part due to its high propensity to metastasize and to develop
   therapy resistance. Adaptive responses to hypoxia and
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are linked to tumor metastasis
   and drug resistance, but little is known about how oxygen sensing and
   EMT intersect to control these hallmarks of cancer. Here, we show that
   the oxygen sensor PHD3 links hypoxic signaling and EMT regulation in the
   lung tumor microenvironment. PHD3 was repressed by signals that induce
   EMT and acted as a negative regulator of EMT, metastasis, and
   therapeutic resistance. PHD3 depletion in tumors, which can be caused by
   the EMT inducer TGF beta or by promoter methylation, enhanced EMT and
   spontaneous metastasis via HIF-dependent upregulation of the EGFR ligand
   TGF alpha. In turn, TGF alpha stimulated EGFR, which potentiated SMAD
   signaling, reinforcing EMT and metastasis. In clinical specimens of lung
   cancer, reduced PHD3 expression was linked to poor prognosis and to
   therapeutic resistance against EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib.
   Reexpression of PHD3 in lung cancer cells suppressed EMT and metastasis
   and restored sensitivity to erlotinib. Taken together, our results
   establish a key function for PHD3 in metastasis and drug resistance and
   suggest opportunities to improve patient treatment by interfering with
   the feedforward signaling mechanisms activated by PHD3 silencing.
   Significance: This study links the oxygen sensor PHD3 to metastasis and
   drug resistance in cancer, with implications for therapeutic improvement
   by targeting this system. (C) 2018 AACR.},

Abstract = {The fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/fibroblast growth factor receptor
   (FGFR) signaling network plays an important role in cell growth,
   survival, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Deregulation of FGFR
   signaling can lead to cancer development. Here, we report an FGFR
   inhibitor, SSR128129E (SSR), that binds to the extracellular part of the
   receptor. SSR does not compete with FGF for binding to FGFR but inhibits
   FGF-induced signaling linked to FGFR internalization in an allosteric
   manner, as shown by crystallography studies, nuclear magnetic resonance,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations,
   free energy calculations, structure-activity relationship analysis, and
   FGFR mutagenesis. Overall, SSR is a small molecule allosteric inhibitor
   of FGF/FGFR signaling, acting via binding to the extracellular part of
   the FGFR.},
