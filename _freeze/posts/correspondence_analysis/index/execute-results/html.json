Like cluster analysis, correspondence analysis is a data reduction procedure that, in contrast to cluster analysis and principal component analysis, is used in particular to describe categorical data that are grouped together in a contingency table [@blasiusKorrespondenzanalyse2001]. In contrast to cluster analysis, however, the characteristics or subjects are not assigned to a cluster, but are localized and related to each other in a space spanned by latent dimensions, which are represented by continuously scaled structural axes. The goal of ca, meanwhile, is to determine an optimal (for various, pragmatic reasons, usually two-dimensional) subspace of a multidimensional hyperspace. In the definition of this system the dimensions are to be chosen in such a way that with them a maximum of the variation of the data can be explained [@blasiusKorrespondenzanalyse2001].\n\nThe ca is primarily interpreted graphically, while numerical interpretation tends to be of lower priority [@backhausKorrespondenzanalyse2016]. The graphical representation possibilities are then probably also one of the main advantages of ca: Thus, ca can represent data structures clearly, graphically, reduce complexity on the basis of latent dimensions, and thus make complex, unknown relationships visible at a glance. The general maxim of exploratory data analysis \"*Let the data speak for themselves!*\" [@lerouxMultipleCorrespondenceAnalysis2010,4] is thus quite redeemed in the context of ca's graphical representations. However, the comparatively catchy \"*geometric maps*\" [@lengerPierreBourdieusKonzeption2013,207] that result from the geometric solution of a ca, also harbor a number of interpretational hurdles that even Pierre Bourdieu was not always able to overcome without error [@blasiusGibtEsFeinen1989; @gollacFrohlicheWissenschaftUber2015].\n\n# Data\n\nThe ca is, at least outside France, known and recognized as *Bourdieu's statistical method* [@lerouxMultipleCorrespondenceAnalysis2010,4]. In fact, however, it was not Pierre Bourdieu who invented this empirical method, often still perceived as \"*strange*\" [@heppEpistemologischeWachsamkeit2014], but his close friend, the analyst and linguist Jean-Paul Benzécris, who first introduced the ca in France in the 1960s.\n\nIn order to stay close to the origins of ca, in the following we use data that Pierre Bourdieu [-@bourdieuDistinctionSocialCritique1987] already supplied to ca in his famous main work *Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste*: We explore the relationship between social class membership, aesthetic attitudes, and favorite painters [@bourdieuFeinenUnterschiedeKritik2012,822-823].\n\n## Data processing\n\nTo do this, we first load the corresponding [contingency table](https://github.com/MalteHueckstaedt/chernoff_faces/raw/master/analysis/04-2022-ca-R/Bourdieu_p822.xlsx) into our workspace using the `read_excel()` function of the `readxl` package and specify (with the help of a [\"*pipe*\"](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html)) as rownames the variable of the social classes that already has the name `rownames` in our excel-sheet.\n\nIn a further step, we print the contingency table (in transposed form for clarity) using the `kable()` function of the `kableExtra` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.2     ✔ purrr   1.0.1\n✔ tibble  3.2.1     ✔ dplyr   1.1.1\n✔ tidyr   1.3.0     ✔ stringr 1.5.0\n✔ readr   2.1.2     ✔ forcats 0.5.1\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'kableExtra'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    group_rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- read_excel(\"Bourdieu_p822.xlsx\") %>% column_to_rownames(\"rownames\")\n\nknitr::kable(t(df), \"pipe\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|                | working classes| middle classes| upper classes|\n|:---------------|---------------:|--------------:|-------------:|\n|sunset          |              90|             84|            64|\n|communion       |              50|             31|            18|\n|folkloric dance |              63|             52|            37|\n|girl with cat   |              56|             60|            50|\n|lactating woman |              44|             55|            53|\n|tree bark       |              17|             32|            48|\n|steel frame     |               6|             12|            23|\n|pregnant woman  |              11|             16|            19|\n|cabbages        |               7|             11|            18|\n|car accident    |               0|              1|             4|\n|Raphael         |              32|             27|            18|\n|Buffet          |               8|             17|             9|\n|Utrillo         |              20|             18|            20|\n|Vlamink         |               6|             12|            11|\n|Watteau         |              16|             19|            16|\n|Renoir          |              49|             51|            48|\n|Van Gogh        |              48|             47|            49|\n|Dali            |               3|              4|             5|\n|Braque          |               5|              7|             9|\n|Goya            |              16|             19|            31|\n|Brueghel        |               1|             12|            27|\n|Kandinsky       |               0|              2|             4|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Correspondence analysis\n\nAs we could see, the complexity of our 3x22 contingency table is so high that correlations between class position and corresponding, aesthetic settings and weaknesses for specific favorite painters are hardly or hardly to be inferred from the table for the naked eye. For this reason, we specify a ca. We load the package `FactoMineR` into our workspace and feed our data to the `FactoMineR` function `CA()` and store the results in the object `ca`. Since the automated graphs of the `FactoMineR` package are not publishable, especially for complex correspondence analyses, we set the `graph` argument to `FALSE`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(FactoMineR)\nca <- CA(df, graph = F)\nca\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Results of the Correspondence Analysis (CA)**\nThe row variable has  3  categories; the column variable has 22 categories\nThe chi square of independence between the two variables is equal to 115.082 (p-value =  1.008015e-08 ).\n*The results are available in the following objects:\n\n   name              description                   \n1  \"$eig\"            \"eigenvalues\"                 \n2  \"$col\"            \"results for the columns\"     \n3  \"$col$coord\"      \"coord. for the columns\"      \n4  \"$col$cos2\"       \"cos2 for the columns\"        \n5  \"$col$contrib\"    \"contributions of the columns\"\n6  \"$row\"            \"results for the rows\"        \n7  \"$row$coord\"      \"coord. for the rows\"         \n8  \"$row$cos2\"       \"cos2 for the rows\"           \n9  \"$row$contrib\"    \"contributions of the rows\"   \n10 \"$call\"           \"summary called parameters\"   \n11 \"$call$marge.col\" \"weights of the columns\"      \n12 \"$call$marge.row\" \"weights of the rows\"         \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we output the object `ca`, we see that our ca was based on a 3x22 contingency table whose row and column variables are statistically significantly related (p-value = 1.008015e-08). Furthermore, we see all storage locations of the central information concerning the specified ca. In order to determine the number of axes of the ca to be taken into account, we first have the eigenvalues and the proportions of the variances \"*explained*\" by the different axes of the ca output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::kable(as.data.frame(ca$eig), \"pipe\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|      | eigenvalue| percentage of variance| cumulative percentage of variance|\n|:-----|----------:|----------------------:|---------------------------------:|\n|dim 1 |  0.0624176|              93.179969|                          93.17997|\n|dim 2 |  0.0045685|               6.820031|                         100.00000|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe eigenvalues correspond to the amount of information each axis contains. The dimensions are ordered in decreasing order and ranked by the amount of variance explained in the final solution of the ca. Dimension 1 of our specified ca explains 93.18% of the variance, and dimension 2 explains 6.82% of the variance [@hjellbrekkeMultipleCorrespondenceAnalysis2018]. The first two axes of the specified ca explain 100% of the variation in the contingency table fed to the ca. Accordingly, within the graphical representation of the geometric solution of ca, we extract the first two axes.\n\nTo do this, we use the `mutate()`- und `select()`-function of the `dplyr`-Package to create a new data-frame containing the coordinates (`ca$row$coord`) of the row and column profiles, as well as their squared cosines values (`cos2`) and contribution values (`contrib`). The former measures the extent of association between row and column categories and a particular dimension of ca, the latter indicates which row and column categories are most significant in explaining the variability of the data on which the contingency table is based. Row and column categories of low importance are characterized by the fact that they do not make a high contribution to any of the first dimensions of a ca [@lerouxMultipleCorrespondenceAnalysis2010].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nca_row <- as.data.frame(ca$row$coord) %>% select(`Dim 1`,`Dim 2`) %>%\n  mutate(type=rep(\"social class\",3),\n         cos2_dim1=ca$row$cos2[,1],\n         cos2_dim2=ca$row$cos2[,2],\n         contr_dim1=ca$row$contrib[,1],\n         contr_dim2=ca$row$contrib[,2])\n\nca_col <- as.data.frame(ca$col$coord) %>% select(`Dim 1`,`Dim 2`) %>%\n  mutate(type=rep(\"taste\",22),\n         cos2_dim1=ca$col$cos2[,1],\n         cos2_dim2=ca$col$cos2[,2],\n         contr_dim1=ca$col$contrib[,1],\n         contr_dim2=ca$col$contrib[,2])\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe two datasets `ca_row` and `ca_col`, which contain the extracted information of the CA, are joined line by line using the function `rbind()` and again specify the names of the line profiles in the column `rownames` for the following graphical representation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nca_df <- rbind(ca_row,ca_col)\nca_df$rownames <- rownames(ca_df)\nknitr::kable(ca_df, \"pipe\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|                |      Dim 1|      Dim 2|type         | cos2_dim1| cos2_dim2| contr_dim1| contr_dim2|rownames        |\n|:---------------|----------:|----------:|:------------|---------:|---------:|----------:|----------:|:---------------|\n|working classes | -0.3020220| -0.0554749|social class | 0.9673633| 0.0326367| 46.6152120| 21.4872327|working classes |\n|middle classes  | -0.0274330|  0.0932834|social class | 0.0796004| 0.9203996|  0.4133641| 65.3025847|middle classes  |\n|upper classes   |  0.3126783| -0.0422438|social class | 0.9820743| 0.0179257| 52.9714239| 13.2101826|upper classes   |\n|sunset          | -0.1593478|  0.0086692|taste        | 0.9970489| 0.0029511|  5.6355867|  0.2278978|sunset          |\n|communion       | -0.4173789| -0.0959956|taste        | 0.9497594| 0.0502406| 16.0829650| 11.6236890|communion       |\n|folkloric dance | -0.2339650| -0.0201684|taste        | 0.9926239| 0.0073761|  7.7591702|  0.7877601|folkloric dance |\n|girl with cat   | -0.0705356|  0.0337091|taste        | 0.8140734| 0.1859266|  0.7701848|  2.4033062|girl with cat   |\n|lactating woman |  0.0467194|  0.0438757|taste        | 0.5313588| 0.4686412|  0.3093915|  3.7281835|lactating woman |\n|tree bark       |  0.3712275|  0.0021798|taste        | 0.9999655| 0.0000345| 12.4658518|  0.0058725|tree bark       |\n|steel frame     |  0.4930348| -0.0667783|taste        | 0.9819855| 0.0180145|  9.2941342|  2.3294917|steel frame     |\n|pregnant woman  |  0.1896658|  0.0256267|taste        | 0.9820712| 0.0179288|  1.5431415|  0.3849018|pregnant woman  |\n|cabbages        |  0.3571570| -0.0503835|taste        | 0.9804881| 0.0195119|  4.2824346|  1.1643537|cabbages        |\n|car accident    |  0.9792702| -0.2239721|taste        | 0.9502905| 0.0497095|  4.4714152|  3.1956868|car accident    |\n|Raphael         | -0.2483293| -0.0032539|taste        | 0.9998283| 0.0001717|  4.4280915|  0.0103874|Raphael         |\n|Buffet          | -0.0080562|  0.3315053|taste        | 0.0005902| 0.9994098|  0.0020578| 47.6064729|Buffet          |\n|Utrillo         | -0.0193692| -0.0702185|taste        | 0.0707084| 0.9292916|  0.0202918|  3.6436581|Utrillo         |\n|Vlamink         |  0.1791711|  0.1642087|taste        | 0.5434912| 0.4565088|  0.8681677|  9.9631457|Vlamink         |\n|Watteau         | -0.0275261|  0.0605970|taste        | 0.1710476| 0.8289524|  0.0360354|  2.3860424|Watteau         |\n|Renoir          | -0.0321726|  0.0011474|taste        | 0.9987296| 0.0012704|  0.1428582|  0.0024827|Renoir          |\n|Van Gogh        | -0.0129299| -0.0357981|taste        | 0.1154028| 0.8845972|  0.0224504|  2.3512007|Van Gogh        |\n|Dali            |  0.1826517| -0.0055608|taste        | 0.9990740| 0.0009260|  0.3733348|  0.0047279|Dali            |\n|Braque          |  0.2119424| -0.0032304|taste        | 0.9997677| 0.0002323|  0.8796806|  0.0027922|Braque          |\n|Goya            |  0.2631705| -0.0952198|taste        | 0.8842418| 0.1157582|  4.2627339|  7.6243880|Goya            |\n|Brueghel        |  0.7816252| -0.0283536|taste        | 0.9986858| 0.0013142| 22.7890942|  0.4097152|Brueghel        |\n|Kandinsky       |  0.7977577|  0.0433777|taste        | 0.9970521| 0.0029479|  3.5609282|  0.1438439|Kandinsky       |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we are ready to plot the graphical solution of the ca.

Carroll et al [-@carrollInterpointDistanceComparisons1986] put it aptly like this: \"\\[...\\]*it is legitimate to interpret distances among elements of one set of points.* \\[...\\] *It is also legitimate to interpret the relative positions of one point of one set with respect to all the points in the other set. Except in special cases, it is extremely dangerous to interpret the proximity of two points corresponding to different sets of points*.[@carrollInterpointDistanceComparisons1986,46]\"\n\nWith this in mind, the graphical solution of our ca can be interpreted as follows:\n\nThe relatively wide gaps between the three class profiles (working class, middle class, upper class) can be interpreted as an indication that the taste profiles of the three classes differ relatively strongly from each other, with the strongest difference in taste profiles between the working class and the upper class: members of the working class prefer a communion, a sunset and the depiction of a folkloric dance as motifs for a beautiful picture with above-average frequency. In contrast, members of the upper class favor less classical motifs such as a tree bark, a steel frame or cabbages. Finally, members of the middle class favor harmonious motifs such as a girl with cat, a nursing woman, or a pregnant woman more often than average. The interpretation of the correspondences between social classes and favored painters could be carried out analogously.\n\nAttention: It would be unjustified to interpret the distance between motifs or painters and classes in the sense that most of the respondents who favor e.g. Kandinsky are also members of the upper class. Rather, we must assume that Kandinsky is simply more highly regarded, relatively speaking, among upper class respondents than is the case among middle or working class respondents [@carrollInterpointDistanceComparisons1986].\n\nIn addition to the interpretation of the meaning of the relation of the row and column profiles, we are further interested in the squared cosines values (`cos2`) of the row and column profiles as well as their contribution values (`contrib`). As we mentioned above, the `cos2` value measures the extent of association between row and column categories and a particular dimension of a ca. The contrib value further indicates which row and column categories are most important in explaining the variability of the data underlying the contingency table.\n\nSince the first dimension of our ca captures over 93% of the variability in the data, we focus our exploration of the `cos2` and `contrib` values only on the first axis of the ca.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Of course, it is recommended to use the role of row and column categories for all other extracted dimensions as well. dimensions to be investigated and reported.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ca_df, aes(`Dim 1`, `Dim 2`,color=cos2_dim1)) + #specify the x and y variable\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color=\"grey\",linetype=\"dashed\")+ #add x-axis\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color=\"grey\",linetype=\"dashed\")+ #add y-axis\n  geom_point(aes(size = cos2_dim1,color=cos2_dim1), alpha=.5)+ # add (red) points corresponding to the coordinates of the variables 'Dim 1' and 'Dim 2\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = rownames), min.segment.length = 0, seed = 42, box.padding = 0.5,max.overlaps = Inf)+  #avoid overlapping labels\n  scale_color_gradient(low=\"#2450a4\", high=\"#d80000\")+ #add manual color shading\n  ggtitle(\"squared cosines values map of correspondence analysis\") + #add main title\n  xlab(\"Dim 1 (93.18%)\") + ylab(\"Dim 1 (6.82%)\") #add axis titles\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe possible values of `cos2` are between 0 and 1. If a column or row feature has a `cos2` value of 1, it is perfectly represented by a dimension. A `cos2` of 0, on the other hand, would indicate that the feature is not represented by the corresponding dimension. As can be seen from the specified squared cosines values map of correspondence analysis, most of the features of the contigency table are clearly correlated with the first dimension and are accordingly acceptably represented by it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ca_df, aes(`Dim 1`, `Dim 2`,color=contr_dim1)) + #specify the x and y variable\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color=\"grey\",linetype=\"dashed\")+ #add x-axis\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color=\"grey\",linetype=\"dashed\")+ #add y-axis\n  geom_point(aes(size = contr_dim1,color=contr_dim1), alpha=.5)+ # add (red) points corresponding to the coordinates of the variables 'Dim 1' and 'Dim 2\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = rownames), min.segment.length = 0, seed = 42, box.padding = 0.5,max.overlaps = Inf)+  #avoid overlapping labels\n  scale_color_gradient(low=\"#2450a4\", high=\"#d80000\")+ #add manual color shading\n  ggtitle(\"contribution values map of correspondence analysis\") + #add main title\n  xlab(\"Dim 1 (93.18%)\") + ylab(\"Dim 1 (6.82%)\") #add axis titles\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe contribution values map of correspondence analysis gives an idea of the pole of the dimensions to which the different column and row categories contribute. It can be seen that the working class makes a central contribution to the negative pole of the first dimension, while the upper class makes a large contribution to the positive pole of the first dimension. Furthermore, the specified plot shows that the 1st dimension is mainly determined by the opposition of working and upper class.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe have seen how to perform a correspondence analysis with R and how to interpret it in a basic way. Despite the comparatively simple interpretation, the ca has several challenges and pitfalls that need to be considered for a correct application. For a low-threshold introduction, I recommend reading @lerouxMultipleCorrespondenceAnalysis2010 or, especially for social scientists, @hjellbrekkeMultipleCorrespondenceAnalysis2018.\n\nIn case you are a novice in R, the package [factoextra](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/factoextra-r-package-easy-multivariate-data-analyses-and-elegant-visualization) offers a beginner-friendly introduction to the visualization of the results of a ca.\n\n# References\n",
