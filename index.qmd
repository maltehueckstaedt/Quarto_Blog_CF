Hi, I'm Malte. I was born in 1983 in Schwedt/Oder. I studied fine art in Hannover (FH Hannover) and Berlin (KH-Berlin) from 2004 to 2009 and sociology in Berlin (HU Berlin) and in Bielefeld (Bielefeld University) from 2014 to 2018. I have been working at the *German Centre for Science and Higher Education Research* (DZHW) since 2018 in various research projects and contexts as a (Social) Data Scientist.
